    "summary": "Dietary Supplements - Meaning, Demand and need in future\n\n\nIncrease\ndemand for Dietary Supplements and Nutraceuticals\nIndia might be a late entrant in the health supplement game,\nbut COVID-19 has brought a renewed focus on healthy lifestyle habits and diet,\nwhich is expected to further boost the adoption of preventive healthcare\nsolutions. \n\nThe growing social media penetration and vernacular content\nplatforms have also broadened the healthcare horizon for Indians. In the end, a\nwin-win for all - For companies, this segment provides a great combination of\ngrowth, profitability, IPR-driven competitive moats, and long-term consumer\nfranchise. Consumers benefit from better health and living, and society in\ngeneral from a reduced healthcare burden.\n\n\nDietary supplements\nDietary supplements are products taken in addition\nto a healthy diet to provide additional health benefits, such as additional\nnutrients. A dietary supplement is a product designed to complement the\ndiet and contains one or more of the following nutritious elements, (DSHEA)\naccording to the Dietary Supplement Health.\nSupplements consist of herb, mineral, vitamin,s or other\nbotanical, amino acids, as well as their concentrations, components, extracts,\nor metabolites. Dietary processing includes intake, digestion, absorption,\ndistribution, and excretion of food and beverages.\n\nNutraceuticals\nA nutraceutical is a substance that is regarded as a food or a\nportion of a food that, in addition to its regular nutritional content,\nprovides health advantages such as disease prevention or promotion is any\nnon-toxic dietary component that has been proven to be beneficial to one's\nhealth in a scientific study. It includes disease treatment or prevention. The\nfunctional component of the food must be standardized and manufactured in the\nnutraceutical product.\n\nKey\nDrivers for the growth \n\nVitamins and Dietary Supplements cover 26% of the\nnutraceuticals market worldwide. They are used as a diet aid for specific\nneeds, from disease-related to sports needs.\n\n\nThe market demand for Vitamins and Dietary Supplements is\ndriven by\n• Increasing attention to health\nand prevention by the consumers\n• Greater customization of needs\nfor different segments of the population\n• Increased health care costs and\nsearch for alternatives to cure specific problems\n• The growth in demand for\nsupplements is mainly driven by probiotic supplements, Fatty Acids (i.e. fish\noils), and protein supplements\n• Herbal/Botanical Supplements\nusage has emerged as a popular complementary and alternative medicine or\nsupplement to modern medicine\n• Rising consumer awareness\nregarding the severity of digestive disorders, stimulates the growth of the\nEnzymes segment\n\n\nUse of Dietary supplements\n\nMultivitamins were the most used supplement from 2010 to\n2021, with 60% of men and women reporting that they use one every day. Between\n2003 and 2021, 61% of women over 60 took calcium supplements, up from 28\npercent in the previous survey. \n\n\nCalcium is required for bone health and the\nprevention of osteoporosis, a brittle bone disease. The use of folic acid\nsupplements remained steady between the two polls. Folic acid is thought to\nprotect women of reproductive age against neural tube birth defects. Folate is\nfound in a variety of foods, including green leafy vegetables, beans, and\nlegumes (a natural form of folic acid). Many breads, cereals, flours, maize\nmeals, pasta, rice, and other foods now include folic acid.\n\n\n\n\nRising Trend for Dietary Supplements\n\n\nTrends in consumer preferences\n• Growing awareness among\nconsumers of the importance of well-being and prevention\n• Increased nutrition needs\nrelated to sports and athletic activities, for the improvement of performance\n• Sophistication of consumer needs\nin terms of specific health needs\n\n\nFactors in the\ndevelopment of the demand\n• Progressive aging of the world population and consequent\ngrowth of specific health needs \n• Habits and lifestyles that are harmful to\nhealth lead to an increase in the need to supplement one's diet \n• Increase in\nhealthcare costs and search for alternative methods of treatment.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Dietary Supplement Market is controlled by\nseveral major players, like\nAbbott India Limited, \nLaurus labs,\nHerbalife International\nIndia Pvt. Ltd., \nAmway India Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., \nDabur India Limited, \nDanone\nNutricia International Pvt.

    "summary": "Edtechs the future of Education\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nNeed for Edtechs\nIn a dramatic shift from the age of gurukuls, the foundation\nof modern education in India was laid under the British Raj, which led to\ntoday’s formal, multiple-layered education structure divided between primary\nand secondary schools, to graduation, post-graduation, diploma, and distance\neducation courses. While schools are governed by education boards such as the\nCentral Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of\nSecondary Education (ICSE), institutions providing higher education are\ngoverned by statutory bodies such as the Medical Council of India (MCI), the All-India\nCouncil for Technical Education (AICTE) and The Bar Council of India (BCI).\n\nOver the course of time, the informal structure of education\nhas developed its roots parallelly with the formal system. This includes\none-on-one tuitions, coaching classes, vocational courses, and technology-based\nsolutions to aid, supplement and replace the traditional modes of education.\nWith the rise of start-ups and technology in India, entrepreneurs in this\nsegment have come across several gaps and pioneered new-age education with\nmodern business models.\n\nIn FY19, the size of India’s education sector stood\nat $101 Bn, and its online education market at $563 Mn. To put it into\nperspective, the country’s online education system comprised a mere 0.56% of\nthe overall education sector. India was ranked 28th among 88 countries in the\nEnglish Proficiency Index 2018, highlighting the country’s position considering\na large English-speaking population allows easy delivery of educational\nproducts.\n\n\n\nReasons for growth \nEdtech startups are gaining popularity as coaching for\ncompetitive examinations is becoming more affordable. Considering that more\nthan 15 Mn students in India prepare for competitive exams, there is a vast\nmarket for edtech startups. Students are today facing rising competition for\nexploring opportunities in the fields of engineering and medicine (at the K-12\nstage), securing government- and public-sector jobs such as Short-Service\nCommission (SSC) and Bank Probationary Officer (PO) respectively, and cracking\nCommon Admission Test (CAT) to take up management studies. \n\nEdtech start-ups today run on lower costs and bandwidth and\nare more technology-driven compared to traditional brick-and-mortar coaching\ncenters. For these very factors, these start-ups are popular in Tier II and\nTier III cities, despite a lack of access to more skilled teachers as in their\nTier I peers. \n\nMany brick-and-mortar coaching institutes too are offering\napp- and web-based solutions in addition to core services to increase their\nonline footprint. The presence of tech companies such as Telegram and Amazon\nIndia (Exam Central Book Store) in this area makes the opportunity in the\nsegment even more appealing for edtech start-ups.\n\nOnline Education Spearheading the Edtech Revolution In India\nBy 2021 the online education market in India is estimated to be worth $2 Bn.\n\n\n\n\nCapital Inflow Reached Historical Peak In 2019 Without\noutliers, the total funding amount surged 2x in 2019 ($283 Mn) compared to $140\nMn in 2018\n\nKey Trends \n·     $433 Mn total funding poured into ed-tech startups\nin 2019 was 36% lower compared to $681 Mn in 2018.\n\n·     Both the number of funding deals and count of\nunique startups funded plunged by 15% and 4% respectively in 2019 compared to\nthe previous year.\n\n·      The average ticket size of the funding amount in\n2019 was $11 Mn compared to $17 Mn in 2018.\n\n·      BYJU’s was the top-funded ed-tech startup in\nIndia for 5 years straight (2015-2019) 79% was the contribution of BYJU’s in the total capital inflow of ed-tech startups for the year 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease in number of Ed techs\nThe $10 Bn Edtech Opportunity by 2025 – Low cost and ease\nwill be driving factors for mass adoption of online education in India.\n\n\nGovernment initiatives driving the Indian EdTech industry\nThe Indian EdTech industry is expected to be more policy-friendly in the upcoming years due to rising government interest. The National\nEducation Policy 2020 emphasized the importance of leveraging technology in\neducation solutions and supported the creation of learning content in regional\nlanguages, calling it a high priority.\n\nIncrease in Internet Penetration\nAccording to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)\n2020, smartphone ownership among government school student families increased\nfrom 30% in 2018 to 56% in 2020, whereas smartphone ownership among private school student families rose\nfrom 50% to 74%.\n\n\n\nDue to the global pandemic, schools and universities across\ncountries have switched to digital or online models to allow students to\ncontinue their learning. This has potentially disrupted the well-established\nmodels in school (K-12) education and university formats permanently.\n\n\nThe popularity of tech-enabled learning solutions in the\nIndian education system is only going to accelerate further as educational\ninstitutions, teachers, parents and governments become increasingly willing to\nadopt the technology. The sector is likely to witness heightened activity in\ninnovation, new ventures, investments, and mergers & acquisitions (M&As)\nin the future.\n\n\nThe only listed player in Edtechs is NIIT. Established in 1981, NIIT, a leading global talent development corporation that is engaged in building skilled human capital and enhancing workforce talent worldwide. With a presence in over 30 countries, the company offers training and development solutions to enterprises and individuals through CLG and SNC businesses.\n\n\nSources: IBEF.org\nInc42\nNIIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Ethanol production capacities, impact on Farmers, and Government Plans\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nEthanol was rarely discussed in the country about 7-8 years\nago. But now ethanol has become one of the major priorities of 21st century\nIndia. The focus on ethanol is having a better impact on the environment as\nwell as on the lives of farmers.\n\nIndia’s requirement of ethanol for petrol blending will\nincrease from 173 crore liters in 2019-20 to 1,016 crore liters in 2025-26. To\nenable the rollout of ethanol production across India, ethanol may be supplied\nfrom surplus to deficit states based on the requirements to ensure uniform\navailability of ethanol blends in the country.\n\nTo achieve the Modi Administration’s E-20 blending goal by\nethanol supply year (ESY) (December-November) 2025, India would need to procure\napproximately 11 billion liters (BL) of ethanol for blending with petroleum. As\nof November 2021, India’s concentrated ethanol production capacity totaled\nslightly above 6 billion liters. Of that amount, approximately 5.25 BL (88%\nshare) is ascribed to distillation units (projects) that use sugar and\nmolasses feedstocks. Conversely, the current grain-based (e.g., corn) distillation\ncapacity consists of 750 million liters. \n\nTo address the production gap, the government has looked to\nincrease India’s grain-based ethanol unit capacity by 5-5.5 billion liters.\n\nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to notify a plan for\navailability of E10 fuel (blend of 10% ethanol and 90% petrol) by April 2022.\nFurther, the Ministry is to notify a plan for the continued availability of fuel for older vehicles. Fuel blended with 20% ethanol (E20) should be launched\nin a phased manner from April 2023 to ensure the availability of E20 by 2025.\nThe rollout of higher ethanol blends may be done in a phased manner, starting\nwith the states with surplus production of ethanol.\n\n\nThe process to procure Ethanol\n\n\n\nIncrease in Production Capacity\nState Production Capacity The number of new grain-based\nethanol projects varies by state. At present, Punjab has 16 grain-based ethanol\nplants, the largest amount, with an installed capacity of 620 million liters.\nSince January 2021, roughly 35 projects have been approved in Maharashtra which\nwould increase the state’s annual capacity by 1.07 BL, according to Post\nsources. \n\nAdditionally, 29 projects were approved in Uttar Pradesh\nwith an additional estimated annual capacity of 1.08 BL, while 20 new projects\ntotaling 1.02 BL of potential capacity were approved in Chhattisgarh. An\nadditional 26 various projects are approved throughout Bihar, Odisha, and West\nBengal. To achieve the estimated 8.59 BL of ethanol produced annually through\nthe new plants, India would need to balance interests in procuring additional\nsurplus grain stocks for fuel against feed/human consumption.\n\nIndia currently has 113 grain-based distilleries\n(Table 1) with a cumulative annual capacity of 2.58 billion liters (Table 1).\nMore than half of these units produce potable liquor (i.e., spirits), which is\nalso among the top tax revenue streams for state governments across India.\n\n\n\n\nBoost farmer’s Income\nRemunerative prices of ethanol to suppliers have more than\ndoubled in the last six years-a major boost to farmers’ income. An eight-fold jump\nin procurement in the last six years and the price of procurement going up by\nnearly 2.5 times, has led to a significant jump in the income of farmers.\n\n\nEthanol supplies and blending percentages have increased more\nthan five times in the last six years. While 38 crore liters of Ethanol were\nprocured during the year 2013-14, in 2020-21 this jumped nearly eight times to\n322 crore liters.\n\n\nEthanol distillation capacities have almost doubled, and the number of distilleries increased by 40% in five years. The decision to\nallow diversion of B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup for\nethanol production in 2018-19 enabled a reliable supply of feedstock and the\nprice stability of sugar.\n\nThere are measures taken to expedite regulatory\nclearances for ethanol production such as expediting the issuing of consent to\nestablish distilleries by state governments. Further, a single-window system\nmay be formulated by the Department\nfor Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to facilitate speedy clearances\nfor new projects and expansion of current projects for ethanol production.\n\n\nSources - AIDA\nAgriexchange India\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Chambal Fertilizers - Company overview & Urea industry synopsis in India\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nCompany Overview \nIncorporated\nin 1985 and based in Kota, Rajasthan, Chambal has the largest installed urea\ncapacity of 3.00 million tonnes in the private sector in India. Chambal is the\nlargest private player in the urea industry in India in terms of production\ncapacity. Its share in the total domestic urea production has increased to\n13.4%, driven by the ramp-up of its Gadepan-III plant. The company has maintained\nits share in the non-urea fertilizers segment.\n\n\nThe company has sold 0.93 million tonnes of DAP/muriate of potash/nitrogen phosphorus\npotassium during the first 9 months of fiscal 2022, down from 1.60 million\ntonnes in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal because of the global\nshortage of the fertilizers amidst the Russia-Ukraine war. Its significant\nmarket share in north India is supported by its strong Uttam Vir brand and\nrobust distribution network. The company also trades in complex fertilizers and\npesticides. The urea plants are near the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur gas\npipeline, which ensures sufficient gas availability.\n\n\nThe Company has 3 manufacturing plants with an annual production capacity of around 3.4 million MT of Urea. All the three Urea\nmanufacturing plants of the Company are located at Gadepan, District Kota,\nRajasthan, which is the largest single location Urea manufacturing facility in\nIndia.\n\n\nRevenue\ntrend past 5 years\n\n\n\n\nUrea growth potential\nThe\nconsumption of Urea is the highest among all the fertilizers used in India. Urea\nis the most important crop nutrient which plays a vital role in ensuring food\nsecurity in the country. The Urea industry comprises manufacturers from the public, co-operative and private sectors. The Urea manufactured in the country\nis not sufficient to meet its total demand. Hence, part of the demand for Urea\nis met through imports. \n\n\n\nThe price of Urea is controlled by the\nGovernment of India. The subsidized price at which the Urea is to be sold to the\nfarmers by the manufacturers is decided by the Government of India and it pays\nsubsidies to the manufacturers based on the applicable policy parameters. Natural\ngas is the main input for the manufacture of Urea. The cost of natural gas is\nconsidered appropriate by the Government of India when determining subsidy\non Urea payable to the manufacturing units. Hence, the fluctuation in prices of\nnatural gas does not have much impact on the Urea manufacturing units.\n\n\n\nOther\nProducts \nThe Company strives to provide all agri-inputs\nunder one roof to farmers. Apart from manufacturing Urea, the Company markets\nother fertilizers and agri-inputs such as Di- Ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Muriate\nof Potash (MOP), and Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS), different grades of NPK fertilizers,\nSulphur, micro-nutrients, and agrochemicals.\n\n\n\nThe company has an established market position and superior operating efficiency of its\nfertilizer plants. Operating performance remains comfortable, with plants\noperating at over 100% utilization and within the prescribed energy norms. The profitability of the urea division will remain immune to the rise in feedstock\n(natural gas) prices as this is compensated through subsidy receipts from the\ngovernment. The global shortage of complex fertilizers, which has led to a\nspike in their prices, could affect profitability in the medium term.\n\n\nProfit\nmargin growth trend\n\n\nGovernment\nsubsidies to boost the growth\nDAP,\nMOP, APS and NPK fertilizers are covered under the Nutrient Based Subsidy\n(“NBS”) policy of the Government of India. The subsidy on these products is\npaid by the Government of India to the Company based on the different nutrients\nin these fertilizers and the Company determines the sale prices of these\nproducts as per NBS. In view of this, the prices of these products are guided\nby market forces. DAP, APS, and NPK fertilizers are manufactured in the\ncountry as well as imported by various players. \n\n\n\nWhile\nthere has been an unprecedented rise in raw material prices (especially pooled\ngas prices) and imported fertilizer rates, the additional subsidies (Rs 60,593\ncrore added to the initial budget of Rs 79,530 crore) announced by the\ngovernment should restrict the increase in subsidy arrears for this fiscal. A\nsimilar addition in the subsidy budget is expected for fiscal 2023, to compensate\nfor the rise in raw material and imported fertilizer prices. Timely\nannouncement and disbursement of the additional subsidies remain key rating\nsensitivity factors.\n\n\n\nHigh\ndependence on imports\nMOP\nis not produced in India and the country is fully dependent on imports. The\nCompany imports these fertilizers from international manufacturers and\nproducers and sells them in its marketing territory under its brands. \n\n\n\nThe\nproduction and imports of these products vary due to factors such as demand,\npipeline inventories, pricing of the products in the international market, cost\nof raw material, etc. Sulphur and micronutrients are purchased from\nmanufacturers in India and imported from international manufacturers. In the case\nof agrochemicals, the technical grade agrochemicals are produced by\nmultinational companies as well as domestic producers. \n\n\n\nChambal\nsold 2.62 million tonnes of urea and 0.93 million tonnes of DAP/muriate of\npotash/nitrogen phosphorus potassium during the first nine months of fiscal\n2022 (2.73 million tonnes and 1.60 million tonnes, respectively, in the\ncorresponding period of the previous fiscal). While the uneven distribution of\nrainfall caused a marginal decline in urea sales, the global shortage of\ncomplex fertilizers impacted sales volume in the domestic market.\n\n\n\nPoints\nto concern\nFurther,\nthe Urea manufactured by the Company is preferred by the customers in its\nmarketing territory due to its good product quality and strong brand image of the\nCompany. Hence, the Company does not foresee much impact on its business due to\nthe capacity addition by new players in the Urea sector. The demand variation due\nto changes in monsoon pattern, volatility in the prices of DAP, MOP, APS, and NPK\nfertilizers, and variation in the foreign exchange rates are a few challenges\nthat the Company faces in its business related to non-Urea fertilizers. The\nCompany continuously evaluates these factors and strives to mitigate them\nthrough dynamic sourcing and pricing of the products and appropriate hedging of\nforeign exchange risk.\n\n\n\nRoadmap\nahead\nThe\nrecent rise in feedstock (natural gas) prices will not impact the operating\nprofitability of the urea production division as it is passed through entirely,\nto be compensated through subsidy receipts from the government. For\nProfitability against production above-reassessed capacity, wherein the incentive\nis capped at import parity price of urea plus incidental charges, to also not\nbe majorly impacted on considering that the imported urea prices are also high.\nHowever, the global shortage of complex fertilizers, which has led to a spike\nin prices, may have a mid-term impact on overall profitability.\n\n\n\nGadepan-III\nplant has enabled the Company to increase its market share in Urea and thus\nenhanced its competitive strength due to more efficient operations on account\nof economies of scale. After the commissioning of the Gadepan-III plant, the Company\nhas started focusing on strengthening its reach in existing marketing\nterritories and expanding in new geographies in the eastern, western, and southern\nparts of India through a concerted brand-building approach.\n\n\n\nA\nfew more plants are expected to be operational to increase the indigenous\nsupply of Urea during the next 1-2 years which shall reduce the demand-supply gap\nin the country. However, these plants are in eastern and southern parts of India\nwhereas the core marketing territory of the Company is the Northern and Central\nparts of India. \n\n\nThe Company has an established brand and sizeable market share in the DAP and MOP fertilizers and making inroads in the NPK fertilizers space. The Company plans to replicate its success in the existing marketing territory in new marketing territories and increase its reach in the existing marketing territories which offers an opportunity for the Company to enhance its sales volumes and market share.\n\n\nShareholding Pattern\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Trends to track in Healthcare Sector\n\n\nWherever we look in the healthcare industry, we can find new\ntechnology being used to fight illness, develop new vaccines and medicines, and\nhelp people to live healthier lives.\n\nIt is apparent that some pharmaceutical companies are\nstarting to recognize the impact of the two major shifts: Downward pressure on\npricing and the move towards prevention, diagnosis, and real cures. These\nchanges are upsetting the established order, opening the door to new\ncompetition, and forcing companies to rethink where they play – and who they\nplay with, requiring a growing emphasis on collaboration and partnership.\n\nOver the last two years, many tech companies have focused on\napplying their expertise to solve problems caused by the global pandemic. At\nthe same time, many healthcare companies that would not necessarily have\ntraditionally been considered tech companies have turned their attention to\ntechnology and its potential to transform the delivery of their products and\nservices.\n\nIt's clear that the pandemic has accelerated the\ndigitization of the healthcare industry. According to the HIMSS Future of\nHealthcare Report, 80% of healthcare providers plan to increase investment in\ntechnology and digital solutions over the next five years. We will continue to\nsee growth in areas including telemedicine, personalized medicine, genomics,\nand wearables, with organizers leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), cloud\ncomputing, extender reality (XR), and the internet of things (IoT) to develop\nand deliver new treatments and services.\n\n\n\nTop 5 trends that will boost the growth of the Healthcare\nsector\n\n\n\nFrom drug discovery and development to medical imaging and\npatient engagement, artificial intelligence occupies a prominent position in\nthe industry. Along with big data and analytics, more than a third of pharma\nstartups are working on software solutions for the industry. \n\nThere is still a lack of access to basic medicines in many\nregions of the world, prompting demand for flexible pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The use of real-world data to collect accurate patient\nexperiences, blockchain to securely transact and manage patient records, and\naugmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR & MR) solutions also find a\nplace in the top 10 pharma industry trends. However, these trends cover only a\nsmall fraction of the breadth of innovation in the industry. Based on your\nspecific criteria, your top trends can look quite different.\n\n1. Remote healthcare and telemedicine\nEven when COVID goes, telemedicine is here to stay. Doctors\nin India were stymied by the lack of clarity – whether I can, or I cannot, and\nif they would be taken to the court. But on 25 March 2020, the Medical Council\nof India amended the ethics part of the rules and the telemedicine practice\nguidelines were issued – it has certain lacunas, but I am sure they will get\nbetter over time. But I think the dissemination of the knowledge that telemedicine\nis legal has not reached the nth degree. So its potential is not being fully\nharnessed. But over time telemedicine consults will become a regularity.\n\n\n\nThe reasons for this increase are obvious – but even when we\ntake communicable diseases out of the equation, there are plenty of good\nreasons to develop capabilities to examine, diagnose and treat patients\nremotely. In remote regions and places where there are shortages of doctors\n(such as China and India) this trend has the potential to save lives by\ndramatically expanding access to medical treatment.\n\n2. Making sense of medical data with AI and machine learning\nThe high-level use case for AI in healthcare, as in other\nsectors, is in helping to make sense of the huge amount of messy, unstructured\ndata that’s available for capture and analysis. In healthcare, this can take\nthe form of medical image data – X-rays, CT and MRI scans, as well as many\nother sources, including information on the spread of communicable diseases\nlike covid, the distribution of vaccines, genomic data from living cells, and\neven handwritten doctors' notes.\n\n\nDigital twins are quickly becoming popular in many\nindustries, in a trend that involves creating models informed by real-world\ndata that can be used to simulate any system or process.\n\nIn healthcare, this trend encompasses the idea of the\nvirtual patient – digital simulations of people that are used to test drugs and\ntreatments, with the aim of reducing the time it takes to get new medicines\nfrom the design stage into general use. Initially, this may be confined to\nmodels or simulations of individual organs or systems. However, progress is\nbeing made towards useful models that simulate entire bodies. Current research\nsuggests this is still some way from being a realistic possibility, but during\n2022 we will continue to see progress towards this goal.\n\nShift in trends – for better future        \nAn increasing number of pharmaceutical firms – and, indeed,\nmedical device companies – are partnering and integrating with technology\nbusinesses. In a bid to tackle the huge and rising blight of diabetes, Sanofi\nand Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet, announced in\nSeptember 2016 that they would invest approximately US$500 million in a joint\nventure to combine devices, software, and medicine.\n\nWe believe medical device companies are leading the\ncooperation with tech companies. For example, in the diabetes space, one\ninteresting partnership involves device giant Medtronic teaming up with tech\nfirm Qualcomm, to develop a continuous glucose monitoring system that will also\nprovide actionable insights to patients and providers.\n\nSoftware is becoming more and more important in our lives,\nand healthcare is no exception. Another pharma tech alliance between Varian\nMedical Systems and Flatiron Health aims to develop cloud-based, electronic\nhealth records, data analytics, and decision support software geared toward\noncology patients.\n\n3. Nutraceuticals are the gem of healthcare\nIn the vitamins and nutrients market, the top five\ncategories constitute ~85% share. Increasing focus on prevention, self-care,\nhealth and wellness, and awareness about the importance of high immunity is\nleading to increased consumption of vitamin and mineral supplements and other\nnutraceutical products.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Biosimilars\nNew chemical entities (NCEs) and new biological\nentities (NBEs) These products are the major focus for leading multinational\npharma companies. Indian companies are beginning to improve their in-house\nnovel drug development with the aim of launching new blockbusters. Developing\nNCEs and NBEs put Indian companies in direct competition with global\ninnovators. Some of the large Indian pharma companies, such as Zydus, Glenmark,\nand Sun, as well as clinical research organizations (CROs) and contract\ndevelopment and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), are already engaged in\nresearching new drugs.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Zydus became the first Indian company to launch an\nindigenously developed NCE, Lipaglyn (saroglitazar), the world’s first glitazar\ntreatment for diabetic dyslipidemia or hypertriglyceridemia in Type II\ndiabetes, not controlled by statins alone. The drug was recently approved as\nthe first drug for the treatment of Non-Cirrhotic and Non-Alcoholic\nSteatohepatitis (NASH) in India (March 2020). \n\nThe second phase of development in the US is expected to\nget approval in 2027. Biocon was the first company to launch indigenously\ndeveloped novel biologics in India. The company launched BIOMab EGFR for head\nand neck cancer treatment in 2006, and Alzumab (itolizumab) for psoriasis\ntreatment in 2013. Both these novel monoclonal antibodies have been launched in\nseveral countries in collaboration with global companies.\n\n\n\n5. Rise in E-pharmacies/ E- Prescriptions\nE-pharmacy holds the potential to improve the accessibility of\nmedicine to even the remotest corners of the country. The first online pharmacy\nwas started in the US in the late 1990s. In India, the e-pharmacy space is still at\na nascent stage. The market was estimated at US$0.5b in 201954 with companies\nsuch as NetMeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, and 1mg dominating the market. It is\nprojected to reach US$4.5b in 2025 at a CAGR of 44% for the period 2019—2025,\nrepresenting about 10%-12% of the pharmaceutical sales (up from 2%-3% levels in\n2019).\n\nIndia’s drug prices are among the lowest in the world.\nHowever, they are still out of reach for a large percentage of the population\ndue to high out-of-pocket expenditure. To tackle affordability issues, price\ncontrol mechanisms have been in place since 1955 when the government first\nimposed price ceilings under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. \n\nMany of the developments in the pharmaceutical industry\nmirror those in the automotive sector. Like pharmaceuticals, the industry is\nrelatively mature and made up of a few major players. And automakers also face\nintense pressure from regulators – in their case to cut emissions, accelerating\nthe move toward electric and other non-polluting vehicles. The growing\ndependence upon technology, primarily software, is attracting the interest of\nnew entrants such as Google, Uber, and Tesla who are focusing on mobility,\nrather than on the automotive industry itself.\n\nPharmaceutical companies that manage to embrace the most\nappropriate archetypes, and master disruption, have the greatest chance to\ndeliver real value.\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

Along\nwith major economic reforms, Government programs, such as the Green\nRevolution have played a critical role in transforming the country’s\nagriculture sector and paved the way towards economic growth of the country. \n\n\nAgrochemicals\nspecifically have played an important role in preventing crop losses to pests\nand improving overall productivity. Proper and scientific usage of\nagrochemicals may lead to approximately 20–30% improvement in productivity.\nCurrently, the usage of agrochemicals in the Indian agriculture sector is amongst\nthe lowest in the world.\n\n\nIndia is one of\nthe leading producers in the world. Be it food grains, horticulture crops,\noilseed production, Agricultural exports, or FDI in the domain, all have\nflourished over the past few decades.\n\n\nTop countries by\npesticide use (000' tonnes)\n\n\n\nEurope and\nAsia-Pacific are the highest consumers of agrochemicals and account for around\nhalf of the global consumption. These regions also account for around 85% of\nthe agrochemical exports around the world, making them the global manufacturing\nand exports hub. Agrochemical consumption around the world has transformed\nagriculture and has helped in achieving substantial gains in yields of many\nagricultural crops. A study in 2013 estimated that pests can cause a yield loss\nof as much as 28.2% in wheat, 31.2% in maize, and 28.8% in cotton. Therefore, there\nis a direct relation between pesticide usage and agricultural production.\n\n\nWith an\nestimated crop loss of above 2 trillion INR per annum due to pests, coupled\nwith a very low level of pesticides usage of 340 g/ha (compared to most developing\nagriculture economies), there is a strong role that agrochemicals can play in\nprotecting food sufficiency and quality of agricultural produce in India, with\nvery favorable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage of\nagrochemicals along with other high-quality agri-inputs has been instrumental\nin improving agricultural production and productivity around the world.\nHowever, there are disparities when it comes to the productivity of major food\ncrops amongst countries.\n\n\nAlthough the\ndisparities can be contributed by many factors, such as the extent of agri-input\nusage, availability of resources, agro-climatic conditions, and markets, it is\nsafe to assume that higher but correct pesticide usage can lead to substantial\nimprovements in yield. The below infographic illustrates a comparison of yields of\nmajor food crops in India with major food-producing countries.\n\n\nIndia is the\nfifth largest producer and the fourth largest exporter of agrochemicals. The\nIndian agrochemicals industry was valued at around INR 42,000 crore in FY20 out\nof which domestic consumption was worth around INR 20,000 crore, while exports\nduring the same period were worth around INR 22,000 crore. The industry is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of 8–10% till 2025 and the growth is expected to be\ndriven by several growth levers like increasing population, decreasing arable\nland, increasing demand for high-value agricultural products, and increasing\nefforts from the industry and the Government to promote awareness and\ntechnology penetration.\n\n\nThe following table highlights the subsegments and user industries wherein specialty chemicals find a large range of applications: \n\n\n\n\n\nImportant trends drive the Indian Agrochemical sector. \nThe following pointers highlight the current and upcoming trends in the agrochemical\nindustries\n•Increasing focus towards digital avenues has improved decision\nmaking and enhanced traceability across the value chain\n•Evolving models like direct selling through FPOs and\ndirect-to-consumer (D2C) platforms like e-commerce are impacting the entire\necosystem of agrochemicals in India\n•Increasing focus on diversification into specialty nutrients\nproducts such as biofertilizers, bio-stimulants, micronutrients, and organic\nproducts has picked up across the industry. These segments have seen multiple\ninvestments in a bid to develop innovative and cost-effective products for\nfarmers.\n•Monetization of farming services such as spraying of\nagrochemicals and direct-to-farm delivery of agri-inputs are changing the\nlandscape of the industry. Various start-ups have come up in the domain and\nhave been trying to capitalize on the existing market demand.\n•Increasing interest of farmers towards solutions like ‘product as\na service, mobile app-based advisory, market information, etc. have enabled\nquick dissemination of information enabling better decision making from\nfarmers. This is also expected to drive farm productivity, profitability, and higher risk-adjusted returns for farmers.\n•Specialty\nchemicals have come up as an attractive emerging area that has witnessed\nstrong growth, new investments, and capability enhancement among Indian\nAgrochemical players. Their application in a variety of end-user industries makes\nthese even more suitable for agrochemical companies as a product offering. \n \nIt’s\ntime to create a 360-degree buzz about the role of agrochemicals in Indian\nagriculture and their importance in ensuring food and nutrition security.\nGovernment and industries should work together, \nreview existing regulatory and policy hassles right from production to\nend consumers, and make a robust plan towards the theme of \"Make in\nIndia and Make for the World.\" Insecticides\ndominate the Indian crop protection market however Herbicides are emerging as\nthe fastest-growing segment.\n\nProduction,\nExport, and Imports of agrochemicals (Unit: 000 tonnes)\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of\nagrochemicals (technical grade) has grown by 11.9% during 9M-FY21. Despite the\nimpact of the coronavirus on the domestic market two consecutive good monsoon\nseasons, the vibrancy of the rural markets, and a good sowing season have attributed\nto an increase in production. New product launches, pro-active raw material planning\nalong efficient capacity utilization have also supported the increase in\nmanufacturing. An increase in manufacturing of technical augurs well for the\nindustry as it is getting more backward integrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the budget announcement, the government also increased the credit for farmers increased from Rs. 15 lakh crores to Rs. 16.5 lakhs crores and decided to further add 1,000 mandies through the eNam platform which is to give benefit to the farmers to sell his crops at better prices which will ultimately improve the profitability of the farming community.\n\n\nGoing forward,\nwith acreage and crop prices both improving, the sector is structurally\nwell-placed also considering the fact that this year’s harvest is slated\nto be a bumper crop and the farming community will be having good liquidity to\nspend money to safeguard their crop from pests and diseases.\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

These regions also account for around 85% of\nthe agrochemical exports around the world, making them the global manufacturing\nand exports hub. Agrochemical consumption around the world has transformed\nagriculture and has helped in achieving substantial gains in yields of many\nagricultural crops. A study in 2013 estimated that pests can cause a yield loss\nof as much as 28.2% in wheat, 31.2% in maize, and 28.8% in cotton. Therefore, there\nis a direct relation between pesticide usage and agricultural production.</span></span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\">With an\nestimated crop loss of above 2 trillion INR per annum due to pests, coupled\nwith a very low level of pesticides usage of 340 g/ha (compared to most developing\nagriculture economies), there is a strong role that agrochemicals can play in\nprotecting food sufficiency and quality of agricultural produce in India, with\nvery favorable cost-benefit ratio.</span></div><p>\n\n\n\n</p><div style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\">Usage of\nagrochemicals along with other high-quality agri-inputs has been instrumental\nin improving agricultural production and productivity around the world.\nHowever, there are disparities when it comes to the productivity of major food\ncrops amongst countries.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\">Although the\ndisparities can be contributed by many factors, such as the extent of agri-input\nusage, availability of resources, agro-climatic conditions, and markets, it is\nsafe to assume that higher but correct pesticide usage can lead to substantial\nimprovements in yield.

    "summary": "Healthcare Global Enterprise Ltd. -  India's Leading Oncology Focused Network\n\n\nBackground\nEstablished\nin 1989, Healthcare Global Enterprises Limited (HCG), is present primarily in\nthe oncology field with the largest cancer care network (with 22 cancer care\ncenters as of December 2021) and three multi-specialty hospitals. It is\npromoted by Dr. B.S. Ajai Kumar, practicing radiation and medical oncologist\nwith over 30 years of experience.\n\n\n\nOriginally\nestablished with a single cancer care center, the Bangalore Institute of\nOncology (BIO), at Bangalore by Dr. B.S. Ajai Kumar and four other oncologists,\nthe company has rapidly expanded its presence to Ahmedabad, Chennai, Nasik,\nRanchi, Rajkot, Cuttack, Hubli, Mumbai, Nagpur, Vizag, and Vijayawada, among\nothers. The company is now present across the oncology value chain, offering\nservices from prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment to rehabilitation,\nsupportive care, and palliative care. \n\n\nPursuant\nto the Investment Agreement entered by the company and promoter with Aceso Company\nPte Ltd (CVC group) in June 2020 and subsequent equity infusion, a majority\nstake of 56.8% (on a fully diluted basis) is now held by the CVC Group.\nEstablished in 1981, CVC is a private equity and investment advisory firm with\nUS$ 114.8 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2021. It has a\nglobal network of 24 local offices - 16 across Europe and America and eight in\nthe Asia Pacific region. \n\n\n\nBusiness Overview\n\n\nStrand\nDivestment\nHCG\nannounced the acquisition of oncology hospital labs and clinical trials\nbusiness from Strand Lifesciences as well as simultaneous divestment of its approx.38.5%\nstake (on paid-up capital basis and 34.5% on a fully diluted basis) in Strand to\nReliance Industries group company. \n\n\n\nHCG\nacquires majority stake in Suchirayu HealthCare Solutions\nHealthCare\nGlobal Enterprises Limited (HCG), the leading specialty healthcare service\nprovider in India focused on oncology, announced the acquisition of an\nadditional 60.9% in Suchirayu Healthcare Solutions (“Suchirayu” or “Company”),\nHubli, thereby becoming a majority stake owner from its existing 17.7% to\n78.6%.\nSuchirayu\nowns a state-of-the-art multi-specialty hospital in Hubli with an operational\ncapacity of 110 beds and a potential to scale up to 250 beds.\n\n\n\nServices\nprovided by HCG Cancer Care\nEach\nof its comprehensive cancer centers offers, at a single location, comprehensive\ncancer diagnosis and treatment services (including radiation, medical oncology,\nand surgical treatments). HCG’s freestanding diagnostic centers and its daycare chemotherapy center offer diagnosis and medical oncology services,\nrespectively. HCG has one of the lowest doctor-related expenses (~15% of\nrevenues) and the attrition rate is just ~5%.\n\n\n\nCapex\nphase to end between FY21 and FY23\nHCG\nwas on a CAPEX overdrive between FY18 and FY20 when Rs 2,662 mn, Rs 2,199 mn, and Rs 2,141 mn were added to its gross tangible assets block in FY18, FY19, and\nFY20 respectively. 9 new comprehensive cancer care centers were added between FY16\nand FY20 which led to the decline in EBITDA margin and RoCE. HCG's new center\nlosses increased to Rs 455 mn in FY20 from around Rs 70 mn in FY17. While it\ntook about 1-1.5 years for the new centers to break even, Borivali and Nagpur\ncenters’ breakeven was delayed owing to the doctor and rent-related issues.\n\n\nWith\nthe commissioning of the South Mumbai center in Q3FY20, HCG is done with its\nmajor CAPEX plan barring small amounts related to its Gurgaon comprehensive\ncancer care center.\n\n\n\nCapital Expenditure\n\n\n\n\nDe-leveraging balance sheet\n\n\nNet debt reduced compared to June 2021\nHCGs net debt on consolidated books reduced by Rs. 67 crores to Rs. 226.8 crore. The reduction was because of Rs. 8 crore-10 crore improvement in FCF and amount\nraised through stake sale in Strand Life Sciences.\n\n\nRevenue Snapshot for Q3FY22\n\n\n\n\n1. Record\nperformance with ‘all-time high’ operating financials delivered across the\nbusiness:\nHighest ever\nquarterly Revenue and Operating EBITDA delivered during the quarter. Strong\nyearly revenue growth on the back of higher footfalls. Consolidated Income from Operations (“Revenue”) was INR 3,581 mn as compared to INR 2,740 mn in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, reflecting year-on-year growth of 30.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. HCG New centers\ncontinued their scale-up trajectory:\nStrong revenue\ngrowth of 54.2% y-o-y o Recorded positive EBITDA with several centers\nwitnessing a turnaround in EBITDA (unit level). Several regions delivered high\ndouble-digit revenue growth on yearly basis on the back of gradual unlocking of\nthe economy.\n\n3.

The business has registered\nimproved digital traction driven by a continuous focus on strengthening clinical\ntalent. The company is looking to focus on market leadership in Bengaluru and\nscaling up North India centers in the near term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Comments\n\nHCG's new patient\nregistration has almost doubled since 2018 and the company currently has above 100,000\nnew patients per annum which in turn has doubled the revenue in the said\nperiod. The fact that 85% of this revenue is Oncology centric is a clear\ntestament to their business model in addition to the deep social impact that they make on the lives of thousands of patients and their families. Looking at the\nfuture, management believes that this growth will enhance not only the back\nof the increasing longevity of patients but also a realization that cancer is\nnow being viewed as a curable and chronic disease with a good lifestyle. \n\nWith the addition of the labs and the clinical\ntrials business, the company is now uniquely positioned to not only enhance its\ndiagnostic capabilities and offerings but potentially redefine precision\nmedicine with end-to-end expertise spanning bioinformatics, genomics, and\nresearch. With 25 hospitals, 21 of which are Oncology focused, HCG has built a\nniche platform in the Indian healthcare space, and with their major CAPEX cycles\nalready done, management believes the future years will see the Company\nbenefiting from these investments.\n\n\n\nThis is the fourth consecutive quarter with all-time-record revenue\nand the second consecutive quarter with all-time-record EBIDTA. Implementation of\ngo-to-market plans across their network locations during the last three quarters has\nstarted showing results through this profitable growth. \n\nOverall, these results were made possible through the execution focus\nand hard work of the entire HCG team, and they remain committed to driving growth\nand optimizing operations in the coming quarters. For the future, they want to\nbuild a long-term relationship with their patients to be their trusted advisors over\na lifetime. \n\nWith\nthat objective in mind, they have begun their digital transformation journey to\ncreate an Omnichannel end-to-end patient engagement platform with the help of\ndigital technology. Management believes that this initiative will accelerate its\ngrowth in the future and help HCG to solidify its leadership position in oncology.\n\n\nLink to Hospital Sector Overview-http://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/01/hospital-sector-upcoming-gem-of.html\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Hospital sector - The upcoming gem of the Healthcare Sector\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing emerging\neconomies over the last two decades, receiving large FDI inflows, which have\ngrown from USD 2.5 Billion in 2000-01 to USD 50 Billion in 2020-21. The\nhealthcare sector, in particular, has received heightened interest from\ninvestors over the last few years.\n\n\nIn the hospital segment, the expansion of\nprivate players to Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations, beyond metropolitan cities,\noffers an attractive investment opportunity. According to Invest India’s\nInvestment Grid, there are nearly 600 investment opportunities worth USD 32\nBillion (INR 2.3 Lakh Crore) in the country’s hospital/medical infrastructure\nsub-sector.\n\n\n\nIndian Government initiatives towards\ndevelopment of hospital sector \nWith respect to pharmaceuticals, India can boost domestic\nmanufacturing, supported by recent Government schemes with performance-linked\nincentives, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India)\ninitiative. Further, between 2018 and 2024, patents worth USD 251 Billion are\nexpected to expire globally, presenting a lucrative opportunity for the\ncountry’s pharmaceutical sector, including the patent market. In addition to\ngeneric drugs, there are investment opportunities in other segments of India’s\npharmaceutical sector, including over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, and contract\nmanufacturing and research.\n\n\nThe hospital's industry is the largest segment of the\nhealthcare services in the country which has proliferated from primary\nhealthcare centers to single and multi-specialty corporate hospitals over the\nyears. The healthcare facilities are delivered to the population through public\nand private routes which are explained below.\n\n\n\nIndia’s healthcare industry comprises\nhospitals, medical devices and equipment, health insurance, clinical trials,\ntelemedicine, and medical tourism. The medical devices and equipment segment,\nexpansion of diagnostic and pathology centers as well as miniaturized\ndiagnostics have a high potential for growth. Medical Value Travel, especially\nwellness tourism, also has bright prospects, given India’s inherent strengths\nin alternative systems of medicine.\n\n\nIndian government Policies and Scheme for\nHealthcare Sector\nPradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)\nPradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY)\nMission Indradhanush\n\nNational Resource Centre for EHR Standards (NRCeS)\nNational Health Policy (NHP) Scheme\nAyushman Bharat\n\n\n\nFDI in India’s Hospital Sector\nIndia’s FDI regime has been liberalized extensively.\nCurrently, FDI is permitted up to 100% under the automatic route (i.e., the\nnon-resident investor or Indian company does not require approval from the\nGovernment of India for the investment) in the hospital sector and in the\nmanufacture of medical devices. In the pharmaceutical sector,\nFDI is permitted up to 100% in greenfield projects and 74% in brownfield\nprojects under the automatic route.\n\n\nFDI beyond 74% in brownfield projects requires\napproval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Between April 2000-June\n2020, India received USD 6.8 Billion in FDI in hospitals and diagnostic\ncenters. In the AYUSH sector as well,\n100% FDI is permitted for the wellness and medical tourism segment.\n\n\n\n\nNeed for development Hospital Sector\nIndia which accounts for nearly a fifth of the world’s\npopulation has 12 beds per 10,000 people mainly in urban areas with the number\nbeing far lower in rural areas. India’s bed density not only falls far behind\nthe global median of 29 beds, it also lags that of other developing countries\nsuch as Brazil (21 beds), Malaysia (19 beds), and Vietnam (26 beds).\n\n\n\nDespite the uptick in Government spending and thrust on\nincreasing insurance coverage, the Government of India’s expenditure on\nhealthcare stood only at 1.4% of GDP in FY18. The continuing disparity of\nhealthcare spending between urban and rural areas has resulted in a sharp disparity\nin healthcare availability across the country. The Government of India is\nplanning to increase public health spending to 2.5% of the Country’s GDP by\n2025.\n\n\nThe public healthcare facilities in India have been\nunable to scale adequately to serve the needs of the large population reaching\nthe interiors of the country has been another challenge. Additionally, several\nof these facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped in terms of basic\ninfrastructure and equipment, and in need of enhanced quality standards and\nprotocols. \n\n\nThis unmet opportunity combined with strong fundamentals\nhas largely led to the private sector taking center stage in the healthcare landscape.\nThe late 1990s witnessed improvement in the economic conditions and made\nprivate healthcare affordable to many Indians. These hospitals turned into\nCentres of Excellence and over time, became the preferred choice for patients and\ncommunities over Government hospitals.\n\n\n\nToday, the healthcare\nsector in India offers a potent mix of opportunities and challenges. The significant gap between ‘required’ and ‘actual’ healthcare infrastructure has\ndriven considerable investment over the years into assets like hospitals and\nother facilities. Healthcare in India today provides corporations with a unique\nopportunity for innovation, differentiation, and profits it has become a\npreferred sector for strategic and financial investments.\n\n\nFew of the Listed Companies in this space:\nHCG\nNarayana Hrudayalaya\nAster DM\nKIMS\nApollo Hospital\nMax Healthcare\n\n\nWe will be covering a few of the above-mentioned companies in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "The evolution is here -  A way towards a sustainable environment\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nWhat is Green Chemistry?\nGreen chemistry is an emerging focus among manufacturing\nindustries that minimizes pollution at a molecular level. Green chemistry is\nthe design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use\nor generation of hazardous substances. Companies are actively designing novel\nconcepts to reduce the emission of hazardous substances and actively switching their\nproduction process to green chemistry.\n\n\n\nThe tremendous shift towards Green Chemistry\nGreen chemistry is an emerging focus among manufacturing\nindustries that minimizes pollution at a molecular level. The idea is that companies\ncan adopt new scientific processes to minimize the toll their products take on the environment. Companies are actively designing\nnovel concepts to reduce the emission of hazardous substances. The changes can be as\nlarge as changing the entire chemistry or even as small as changing certain catalysts to reduce carbon footprints. Companies are actively switching their production process to\ngreen chemistry.\n\nGreen chemistry is fundamentally trying to minimize the\nimpact on the environment from our chemistry. It also nicely combines with\neconomic benefits because the fewer materials you need, the less waste you\ngenerate and the more cost-effective your production processes will be.\n\nBiocatalysis allows chemists to use enzymes for\nspecific chemical reactions instead of rare and toxic transition metals. Green\nchemistry has the unique benefit of being a win-win for both business and the\nenvironment as mentioned in the table below, which is why the principles of\ngreen chemistry extend far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to scale up action on green and\nsustainable chemistry?\nThe number of chemicals is ever-increasing, and hazardous\nchemicals and other pollutants continue to be released and disposed of in large\nquantities, affecting individuals and communities worldwide. Synthetic\nchemicals are now ubiquitous in humans and the environment. Chemical pollution has\nbecome a major cause of human disease and premature death. The World Health\nOrganization (WHO) estimated the burden of disease from selected chemicals at\n1.6 million lives and 44.8 million disability-adjusted life years in 2016 which\nis likely to be an underestimate.\n\nIndia’s specialty chemical companies are gaining\nfavor with global multinational corporations because of the geopolitical shift after the  COVID-19  outbreak as the world looks to reduce its dependence on China.\n\n\nThe\nworld is seeking to address sustainability issues in terms of clean energy,\nrenewables, water waste, and overall waste reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian government Initiatives to boost Green Chemistry\nIndian government bodies such as the Department of Science\nand Technology, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, and the Department\nof Pharmaceuticals, are beginning to organize various GC initiatives including\npartnering with SMEs to partially fund investments in green technology. \n\nGeneric drug pharma and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n(“API”) manufacturers in India exhibit significant interest and some advances\nin using GC principles. At the same time, 65% of Indian companies rely on\ntreatment and disposal of wastewater\ninstead of source reduction and one in\nfive (20%)  do not use any GC metrics.  The study found that generic pharma is more\nadvanced in adopting GC principles than API manufacturers. Regulatory risk and\ntime pressures to deliver drugs were reported as the two most significant barriers for greater\nadoption of GC in India, while cost savings and environmental regulations were\ncited as the top two drivers.\n\nGreen Chemistry in Pharmaceuticals\nThe pharmaceutical industry was among the first to embrace\nGreen Chemistry (“GC”) for its significant potential to reduce costs and risks.\nGreen pharmaceuticals as a segment are projected to grow to USD96.2 billion in\n2026. The pharmaceutical industry is continually seeking ways to develop\nmedicines with less harmful side effects and using processes that produce less\ntoxic waste.\n\nFor example, Merck and Codexis developed a second-generation\ngreen synthesis of sitagliptin, the active ingredient in JanuviaTM, a treatment\nfor type 2 diabetes. This collaboration leads to an enzymatic process that\nreduces waste, improves yield and safety, and eliminates the need for a metal\ncatalyst. Early research suggests that the new biocatalysts will be useful in\nmanufacturing other drugs as well.\n\nGreen Chemistry in Paints\nOil-based \"alkyd\" paints give off large amounts of\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). These volatile compounds evaporate from the\npaint as it dries and cures and many have one or more environmental impacts.\n\nFor example, Procter & Gamble and Cook Composites and\nPolymers created a mixture of soya oil and sugar that replaces\nfossil-fuel-derived paint resins and solvents, cutting hazardous volatiles by\n50%. Chempol MPS paint formulations use these biobased Sefose oils to replace\npetroleum-based solvents and create a paint that is safer to use and produces\nless toxic waste.\n\nBiodegradable Plastics\n\nSeveral companies have been working to develop plastics that\nare made from renewable, biodegradable sources. \n\nFor example, NatureWorks of Minnetonka, Minnesota, makes\nfood containers from a polymer called polylactic acid branded as Ingeo. The\nscientists at NatureWorks discovered a method where microorganisms convert\ncornstarch into a resin that is just as strong as the rigid petroleum-based\nplastic currently used for containers such as water bottles and yogurt pots.\nThe company is working toward sourcing raw materials from agricultural\nwaste.\n\nAs the name suggests, green chemistry reduces and to an\nextent eliminates the production and use of hazardous substances in mining and\nin the design, manufacture, and application of chemical products. It also\nencourages energy savings and a better environment and health.\n\nBio-pulping process for Circular Economy\nThe circular economy is an appropriate way for the development of the pulp and paper industry which has intensive resources consumption and\nenvironmental pollution. The concept of CE emphasizes the effective management of\nresources from cradle to grave. As shown in straw was used as input in the bio-pulping process where the enzyme was used, and paper products were produced\nafter the thermal and mechanical processes. Then the pulp waste was utilized in the\nproduction of biogas, or it can be burned for energy production. The generated\npower and biogas can be applied to paper products again. The fly ash from\npower plants can be effectively utilized as fertilizer for corps.\n\n\n\nThe market potential for green and sustainable chemistry\nThe evolution of green chemistry in the chemical industry\nwill be a critical trend fuelling the growth of the green chemicals market. The\nglobal green chemicals market is expected to grow by USD 45 billion by 2025 at\na CAGR of 10.5% between 2019 and 2025.\n\n\n\nOpportunities for green and sustainable chemistry\nRecent innovations in chemistry and advanced materials have created new opportunities throughout the value chain to advance sustainability. These include, for example: revolutionizing energy storage and battery development; creating sustainable building materials improving the recyclability and biodegradability of several products, or turning carbon dioxide (CO2) and wastes into chemical feedstocks and valuable products.\n\nGreener and more sustainable innovation at the interface of chemistry, biology, and clean science are particularly promising.\n\n\nFew of the Indian companies planning their way to green chemistry\nPraj Industries - CBG projects\nSyngene - Through Amgen\nClean Science and Technologies - Focused on Green Chemicals\nand many more...\n\n\nSource: Chemical Engineering Transaction\npWc Indian Chemical 2021\nUN Environment Programme\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Indian speciality chemical companies are all set with huge CAPEX to cater to the demand\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nThe Indian chemical industry is one of the fastest-growing\nindustries in the world. Currently, it ranks 3rd in Asia and is the 6th largest\nmarket in the world with respect to output, after the US, China, Germany, Japan\nand South Korea. The industry's growth is mainly driven by consumption growth\nand export opportunity.\n\nDemand for speciality chemicals is owing to their performance-enhancing applications instead of composition. Businesses operating in this\nsector require deep knowledge and the ability to bring about consistent\ninnovations. The speciality chemicals industry is a mature sector with proven\nbenefits accruing to a wide range of end-use customers. It comprises about 17%\nof the global chemicals market and is expected to grow at an average of 5.3%\nbetween 2019 and 2024, picking up the pace on the back of emerging usage\napplications in a variety of industrial sectors.\n\nThe speciality chemicals industry can be sub-divided based on\nend-user industry into agrochemicals, dyes and pigments, personal care\ningredients, polymer additives, water chemicals, textile chemicals and\napplication-driven segments. These are the largest constituents of the\nspeciality chemicals industry and cumulatively constitute over 80% of the\nspeciality chemicals universe.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nlast two decades have seen a significant shift in the global speciality\nchemicals industry with developed countries losing their production supremacy\n(particularly the US) to emerging market nations in Asia. Key facilitators for\nthis shift include stricter environmental norms in western countries and cost\nadvantages enjoyed by emerging markets in terms of logistics and labour. Further,\ncompanies wanted to shift closer to demand centres and optimize their supply\nchains. The Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with a share of 48-50%, was the key\ncontributor to the global speciality chemicals market.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian speciality chemicals market to witness sharp growth\nIn terms of region-wise demand, India’s speciality chemicals\nindustry is expected to witness the growth of 10-12% CAGR between 2020 to 2025, due\nto rising demand from end-user industries, coupled with tight global supply on\naccount of stringent environmental norms in China. Markets like the Americas,\nEurope and Japan are expected to clock less than 3% CAGR over the next five\nyears, due to industry saturation in these regions. China’s speciality chemicals\nindustry, which saw historical growth rates of ~20% and above until 2013, is\nexpected to witness slower growth, of 4-6% CAGR, between 2020 to 2025, due to\nvarious factors like environmental regulations, leading to an overall slowdown in\nthe industry.\n\nAt present, specific areas of usage include:\n• Agriculture, requiring fertilizers and crop protection\napplications\n • Electronics, needing agents to produce printed circuit\nboards and other components\n • Housing, which relies on chemicals for construction\nmaterials, sealants, coatings, paints and plastics\n • Consumer goods, such as perfumes, detergents, paper items\nand pharmaceuticals Sub-segments within the Speciality Chemicals sector based\non end-usage\n\n\n\nKey growth drivers for speciality chemicals industry in\nIndia\nIncrease in consumption intensity\nHigher end-user demand\nGovernment initiatives\nFavourable Global factors\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital expenditure in the\nIndian chemical space\nIndian chemical industry has been\nrevving up its Capex over the past decade to be well equipped and more\ncompetitive to grab future opportunities. Aggregate Capex incurred by 31\nleading chemical companies considered by us has grown at a 17% CAGR over\nFY15-20 and a 9% CAGR over FY10-20. INR 95bn was spent in FY20 by these\ncompanies on Capex as compared to INR 39bn in FY10. Capex as a percentage of\nrevenue was 9.6% in FY20, the highest ever in the past decade. \n\nCompanies are continuing to spend\nheavily on Capex to meet the demand of these industries as they pose great growth\nopportunities, given the current pandemic situation. Some companies have\ndelayed their Capex investments due to the COVID-19 crisis but have not\nabandoned them.\n\n\nConsolidation of vendor ecosystems\nis an emerging theme across global chemicals supply chains, with many products\nbeing sourced from countries with robust ecosystems. These trends stem from\ncutting the need to cut costs, drive volumes and adhere to global\nenvironmental regulations. India is well-positioned with a scalable, compliant\necosystem for manufacturing chemicals. With the US-China political equations\nimpacting trade over the last few years, tariffs on Chinese exports to the\nUnited States are rising significantly. Thus, manufacturing imports from China\nto the US are declining and buyers are actively looking for new supply sources\nacross the world.\n\n\nIndia is positioned to benefit from the\nsituation, as an emerging global manufacturing location possessing strong\nproduct/process capabilities across a growing number of chemistries. Its robust\nmanufacturing ecosystem is supported by diverse raw materials availability, safety/health/environment compliance is strictly followed, and client\nrelationships have been deepened over the years, supported by a deep culture of\nR&D as well as strong IP governance.\n\n\nList of companies with huge CAPEX - Aarti Industries, SRF, Alkyl Amines, Balaji Amines, Navin Fluro, Vinati Organics, Tata Chemicals, Neogen Chemicals, DMCC\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Rapid Increase in Ethanol Production Capacity\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nTwo Different types of processes  to produce Ethanol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo produce 684 crore liters of ethanol by the sugar industry\nby 2025-26, sugarcane equivalent to 60 LMT of surplus sugar would be diverted\nto ethanol. In the current sugar season, 2020-21 more than 20 LMT of sugar is\nestimated to be diverted. To produce 666 crore liters of ethanol/ alcohol from\nfood grains by 2025-26, about 165 LMT of food grains would be utilized. At\npresent damaged food grain availability is around 40 lakh tons in the country. \n\nIn 2020-21 approximately 20 lakh ton maize is surplus FCI\nRice is also sufficient in stock (266 LMT) and it will continue to remain\nrobust as procurement of paddy/rice at MSP continues at expected levels. The\ncountry is producing sufficient food grains and sugar to meet the requirement\nfor ethanol.\n\nMolasses-based distilleries have also been offered interest\nsubvention to convert them to dual feed, to convert both food grains &\nmolasses into ethanol. Thus, it is expected that there would be sufficient\nethanol distillation capacity to achieve blending targets. DFPD is effectively\nmonitoring the situation and encouraging states and investors to set up new\nindustries and make sufficient availability of ethanol for blending. \n\nUnder the PM-JIVAN scheme, 12 commercial plants and\n10 demonstration plants of Second Generation (2G) Bio-Refineries (using\nlignocellulosic biomass as feedstock) are planned to be set up in areas having\nsufficient availability of biomass so that\nethanol is available for blending throughout the country. Already Rs. 1969.50\nCrores have been earmarked for this scheme. These plants can use feedstocks\nsuch as rice straw, wheat straw, corn cobs, corn stover, bagasse, bamboo and\nwoody biomass, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the year 2017-18, the installed capacity of molasses-based distilleries was around 278 crore liters. To enhance ethanol production capacity in the country, the government in July 2018 & March 2019 notified two interest subvention schemes for molasses-based distilleries. Under the aforesaid scheme of DFPD, interest subvention at the rate of 6% per annum or 50% of the rate of interest charged, whichever is lower on the loan sanctioned was borne by the central government for 5 years.\n\n\nDFPD approved 368 projects for setting up of new distilleries/expansion of existing distilleries. Loans amounting to about Rs.3600 crore have been sanctioned by banks to 70 sugar mills so far; 31 projects have been completed creating a capacity of 102 crore liters as a result. The capacity of molasses-based distilleries has reached 426 crore liters. 39 more projects with a capacity of 93 crore liters are likely to be completed by March 2022 which will bring cumulative capacities to about 519 crore liters.\n\n\nIntending to achieve blending targets, DFPD is making concerted efforts to enhance the ethanol distillation capacity in the country. For this, the government had invited applications from the entrepreneurs under the ethanol interest subvention schemes in September 2020 during a window of 30 days. Thus far, 238 projects for a capacity enhancement of 583 Cr liters with a loan amount of about Rs.16,000/- crore have been approved by DFPD. It is expected that at least 400 Cr liters capacity would be added to these projects by 2024.\n\n\nAn Integrated Bio-Refinery Model\nThe concept of an integrated Bio-Refinery model or Bio-park\nis being envisioned which will encompass the integration of the following\nfacilities: \n1. 2G Ethanol plant: Second Generation or 2G ethanol plant\ncan convert agricultural residues like rice straw, wheat straw, energy crops, etc. to ethanol. With around 160MMT of surplus agricultural residues generated\nin India annually, 2G ethanol plants offer significant opportunities in India. A\n100 km per day plant can utilize 2 lakh tonne per annum of agricultural residue\nto generate around 3 crore liters of ethanol per annum. \n\n\n2. Grain-based 1G Ethanol Plant - Grain-based First\nGeneration or 1G Ethanol Plant can convert the starch present in grains like\nrice, corn, etc. to ethanol. Some by-products like CO2 & Dried Distillers\nGrains with Solubles (DDGS) are also generated which can generate additional\nrevenue. A 100 km per day 1G plant is estimated to incur capital expenditure of\naround `170 to 200 crores with a land requirement of approximately 20 acres. \n\n\n3. CBG Plant - Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) or Bio-CNG can be\nproduced from agricultural residue, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), cow dung, etc.\nCBG can easily replace CNG. The bio-manure produced in the plant is an\nadditional source of revenue. The estimated capital expenditure for a 15 tonne\nper day CBG plant is around Rs.60-100 crores, depending on the feedstock and\nthe land requirement of approx. 15 acres.\n\n\n4. Production of Chemicals - Production of bio-chemicals in\nthe Bio-refinery will improve its economics significantly. Some technologies\nfor the production of biochemicals are ready for commercialization while many are\nstill in the development stage.\n\n\n5. Cogeneration Plant - Setting up of a Cogen plant by using\nLignin (generated in 2G plant) & Biogas (CBG plant) can ensure continuous\n& reliable power supply to the Bio-Refinery. Some of the advantages of Integration\nof various plants in a Bio-Refinery are - \n\n\nImproved economics with reduced cost of feedstock and\nsustenance of biomass supply-chain on a long-term basis. With the setting up of\n1G, 2G, and CBG plants in the same premises, there can be a common source/agreement\nfor the supply of grains (for 1G Ethanol Plant) and supply of waste\nstraw/agricultural residue generated (feedstock for 2G/CBG Plants). \n\n\nOptimization of common resources like Utilities (Cooling tower, Boiler, ETP, etc.) & Offsite facilities (tankages, loading Gantry, firefighting system, etc.) can reduce capital expenditure. \n\n\nIntegration of 1G ethanol and CBG plants with established\n& proven technologies can bring in economic viability & sustainability\nof the Bio-Refinery since 2G ethanol technologies are still in the maturing\nstage. Optimization of Equipment Spares & Manpower required for\nOperation / Maintenance of the plants.\n\n\n\nThe Future Landscape of Opportunities\nEthanol Industry is expected to grow by 500% By 2025, at a 20% blending level, ethanol demand will increase to 1016 Crore liters. Therefore, the worth of the ethanol industry will jump by over 500% from around 9,000 Crore to over 50,000 Crore.\n\n\nEthanol distillation capacity to grow by more than three times to 1,500 Crore liter annually Financial assistance scheme introduced by DFPD during 2018-2021 to increase ethanol production capacity.\n895 proposals with a loan amount of 70,419 Crore. Estimated 165 LMT of surplus grain to be utilized annually from 2025 to produce ethanol which would result in 30,000 crore payments to farmers.\n\n\nLaunch of new vehicles compatible to run on E20 fuel from 2023 and flex-fuel vehicles from 2024. This will attract new investment and create employment opportunities.\n\n\nYear-wise & Sector-wise Ethanol Production Projections \n\nThe shortfall incapacity in any year can be compensated as sugar mills are also using\nsugar-rich feedstocks like B heavy molasses/sugar syrup which produces 20% more ethanol of\nrated capacity. Now many mills have started using these feedstocks in place of C heavy molasses.\n\n\nSources & Credits - NITI Aayog Research Report\nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Gas\n\n\nPart 1 Ethanol Blog: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/05/ethanol-demand-market-size.html\nEthanol-based company analysis Praj Industries: - https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/01/praj-industries-apis-fermentation.html\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Tata Chemicals - https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/02/tata-chemicals-huge-opportunities-ahead.html\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nRecent updates about the company\n\nThe chemical industry can play part in these sustainability\nsolutions – reducing carbon emissions, turning waste into useful products, i.e.\ncircular economy. Tata Chemicals can also play into chemicals going into health\nand hygiene – it already plays some bit through detergents and other\napplications of sodium bicarbonate.\n\nGrow volumes & maximize realizations in soda ash (price\nincreased in Q2 FY22).\nTimely execution of capacity expansion: Salt 165k MT by\nend of FY22.\n\nSoda ash demand drivers\nDemand is likely to remain strong thanks to growing new\napplications in sustainability solutions. Soda ash demand is likely to pick up\nfrom the use of glass panels (flat glass) into solar cells, lithium carbonate\n(every ton needs one ton of soda ash), and the move to container glasses from\nplastics. This is likely to drive a significant uptick in soda ash demand.\n\nIndian soda ash suppliers are in a\nsweet spot. Indian soda ash suppliers are going to benefit given\n(1) surplus availability of salt,\n(2) good availability of limestone\nand\n(3) improving energy\ncompetitiveness given the shift to compliant fuels across the globe. \n\n\nA rise in\nlogistics costs has reduced the competitiveness of imports from markets like\nthe US and Kenya into India and Southeast Asian markets. Synthetic soda ash\nfrom India is likely to turn competitive for exports too in Southeast Asia as\nwell as the Middle East apart from becoming more competitive within India.\n\n\nGrowth in near terms\n·       \nFirst tranche of Soda Ash, Bicarb & Salt\nexpansion on stream by FY23, delivering incremental revenues.\n·       \nContinue to focus on costs.\n·       \nQualification with customers on Prebiotics &\nSilica\n \nInternational business\nExport price maximization &\ntarget higher domestic realizations during contract renewals in Q4 FY 22.\nHold volumes & pricing - Target\nhigher realizations during contract renewals in Q4 FY 22.\nOperational efficiencies through\ncost structure rationalization.\nSustain volume growth momentum.\n \nChina is unlikely to increase its capacities.\nChinese soda ash capacities may\nnot increase substantially on the synthetic side given\n(1) limited availability of salt\nand\n(2) declining use of ammonium\nchloride (a byproduct in Hou process which Chinese use for synthetic soda ash)\nas a fertilizer.\n\n\nNatural soda ash demand\nNatural soda ash capacities in\nChina are growing in Mongolia but are uncompetitive vis-a-vis China due to\nhigher logistics costs. As per internal estimations of Tata Chemicals, China is\nlikely to continue to be a net importer.\n\n\nThe natural soda ash market has three\nsources of supply. Turkey, Kenya, and the US are the three sources of supply for\nnatural soda ash. Turkey is likely to have reached optimal capacity levels and\nis unlikely to see an incremental supply increase. Geopolitical instability is\nalso likely to play a part in keeping supply/demand in check. Kenya and the US\nare also likely to remain stable and contribute only to local growth markets.\nThe US may support incremental growth in LATAM due to increased use in lithium\ncarbonate.\n\nOverall pricing environment to tighten driving better RoCEs\non new projects. Turkey-led supply disruption is already behind us. With most\nof the markets not adding substantial capacities, demand-supply would get\ntightened with most soda ash buyers likely to focus on gaining supply security.\n\nExternal factors\nNo headwinds in the medium term in terms of environmental\nactivism environmental laws are already high in the US. TCL operations are\nfully compliant and protective of the environment. In Kenya, the company is not\nfacing any legal challenges so far and working out on royalty rates with the government.\nLake Magadi in Kenya is a self-replenishing lake company so doesn’t see\nchallenges on the sustainability side.\n\nCapacity expansion\nTata Chemicals has headroom to expand capacity in the US by\n10%-12% over current capacity. India offers the best returns on incremental\ninvestments followed by Kenya for new capacity expansion.\n\nTata Chemicals is looking for Rs26 bn investments in India\nsoda ash and allied products expansion as well as Rs9 bn investments in Rallis.\nThey have a few more projects in the pipeline which will get announced\ngradually.\n\nTata Chemicals sees multiple solutions for storage\nand mobility. It is an evolving field and many plays are possible in hydrogen\ncells as well as batteries. In both, electrochemistry is used and hence Tata\nChemicals is confident about doing well in either space. Tata Chemical's intent\nis to play directly as well apart from their presence through soda ash. They\nare also entering the area of battery recycling.\n\n\nSource: \nQ2FY22 Investor Presentation\nKotak Institutional Equities\nICICI Securities\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Construction chemicals Industry - Unseen opportunities ahead\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe global construction industry makes up\nabout 12% of the world's GDP and construction is one of the main drivers of\ngrowth in almost every economy. The Global Construction & Building\nMaterials Market size was estimated at USD 916.31 billion in 2019 and is\nexpected to reach USD 946.26 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 5.76% reaching USD\n1,282.56 billion by 2025. \n\n\nA variety of chemicals and advanced materials (CAMs)—\nranging from concrete admixtures to polymer composites— are increasingly being\nused in the buildings and construction industry. Construction CAMs include\nconcrete admixtures, adhesives and sealants, protective coatings, insulation\nmaterials, and polymer composites.\n\n\nAs with other areas of the specialty\nchemicals sector, the construction chemicals industry is directly affected by\nincreased globalization, consolidation, and significant consumption growth in\nrapidly developing markets. So, it is not surprising that the future growth\nrate for construction CAMs are expected to be more than 6-8% per annum, with the\nmost incremental growth emanating from the Asia-Pacific region. An uptick in\nconstruction and building activity driven by rapid urbanization and a growing\npopulation is expected to be a major impetus behind this impressive growth.\n\n\n\nOpportunities\nThe construction chemicals industry will\nsee continued opportunities to address energy conservation and sustainability.\nSuppliers can benefit from government policies that require the use of\nspecialty construction chemical products to aid in energy conservation.\n\n\nThe Indian construction chemicals market is\nestimated to witness healthy growth, at an estimated CAGR of over 8%, over\nthe forecast period. The Indian construction chemicals market follows a\nslightly different trend than that of the global market. Due to the lack of awareness\nabout the long-term benefits of construction chemicals, the demand for\nchemicals, such as concrete admixtures, adhesives, sealants, and waterproofing,\nwhich have immediate tangible effects, is high.\n\n\n\nA booming market for construction chemicals\nand advanced materials\nThe global construction CAMs market is expected\nto grow from $57 billion in 2016 to $87 billion by 2023, clocking a CAGR of\nmore than 6 percent. The highest contribution to the incremental growth from\n2016 to 2023 will likely come from the Asia-Pacific region, specifically China,\nIndia, and Southeast Asia.\n\n\nGlobal market size and growth of\nconstruction chemicals and advanced materials.\n\n\n\nFew trends in buildings and construction\nthat are shaping the future\n1. Technology advances and integration\n2. Sustainability and the circular economy\n3. Trends in project completion timelines and\noverall costs\n4. Skilled labor shortage\n\n\nBuilding & construction chemicals market (USD Billion)\n\n\n\n\nInvestment policies\nTarget to increase the share of\nmanufacturing in GDP to at least 25% by 2025 (from current 16%). Investments in\nmanufacturing in the chemical sector are essential to ensure the growth of the\nIndian chemical industry Government’s proposal to set up a technology\nup-gradation fund of ~USD 80 Mn in the 12th plan for chemicals. \nProposal to\nestablish an autonomous USD 100 Mn chemical innovation fund by securing 10% of\nthe total inclusive national innovation fund set up by the National Innovation\nCouncil to encourage commercialization efforts for innovations generating\ninclusive growth.\n\n\n\nThe\ngovernments of developed as well as developing countries are focusing highly on\ngreen building standards.

    "summary": "CAPEX Acceleration in Indian Chemical\nCompanies -  USD 300 bn  domestic market by 2025\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIndia’s\nchemical industry was estimated to be worth USD 178 billion in FY 2019-20 and\nhas a significant potential to reach USD 300 billion by FY 2024-25. In terms of\ndemand, the industry has grown at approximately 1.3 times the country’s average\nGDP growth in the last five years and shows a strong linkage with its GDP. Indian\nspecialty chemical sector has grown at 12%+ in the last five years and is well\npoised to expand its global market share to 7-8% from 4% in the coming years. \n\n\nThe\nstructural drivers are in place like global best practice manufacturing\nstandard and R&D capability along with government impetus of make in India\npolicy with pro-growth policies will act as a further catalyst for growth.\nFurther, a global MNC looking at China Plus one strategy will help Indian\nincumbents to gain market share. In the short to medium term, supply\ndisruptions emerging from power outages in China along with limited new\ncapacity addition provides a tactical opportunity for Indian players to increase\nmarket share and also will get benefits for increase in products prices.\n\n\nDemand\nfor chemicals in India is poised to reach USD 300bn by FY25 from USD 178bn in\nFY20, according to the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals’ presentation\nduring its India Chem March 2021 Conference. Demographic dividend, low per\ncapita consumption, growing disposable income, urbanization, rural consumer\npenetration, increasing export demand and government initiatives are key growth\ndrivers.

However, during\nthe past decade, the same spending on environmental compliance has led to\ndomestic products becoming costlier than China’s.\n \nWith the stricter\nenvironment norms in China and consequent supply uncertainty, India’s chemicals\ncompanies are at an inflection point of gaining major share globally, resulting\nin increased capacity utilization and margins.\n \nConsolidation in the industry,\nenvironmental reforms, and tightened financing is changing the structure of\nChina’s chemical industry, resulting in uncertainty for companies dependent on\nthe country for their supply of raw material. In addition, the COVID-19\noutbreak has compelled companies to move their supplier base and look for\nalternative locations such as India that offer the advantage on low-cost labor\nand favorable investment policies.\n\n\nImpact\nof China’s policy on Indian Chemical Companies\n\n\nChina’s chemicals industry\nis facing structural headwinds in the form of tightening environment norms,\nstricter financing, and consolidation, leading to global supply concerns. These\nfactors promote India as a strong global supplier. As per BCG Survey, 44% of US\nCFOs and 25% of North Asian CFOs say firms are already moving production out of\nChina.\n \nIndian Specialty chemical industry witnessed\nstrong y-o-y demand and improved pricing scenario (led by cost-push) in general\nduring Q2. Such a scenario couple with a covid impacted base of last year makes\nthe revenue trend strong.\n \nWhile there is some sequential\nstagnation in the demand trends driven by the trade challenges, the product\nprices remained firm/stable in Q2 primarily driven by a spike in input/freight\ncost. While Crude prices saw a steady rise (+67% YoY, +4% QoQ), the prices of\nmost key inputs like - Benzene (127% YoY, -3% QoQ), Toluene (74% YoY, 5% QoQ),\nPhenol (118% YoY, 13% QoQ), caprolactum (115% YoY, 28% QoQ), etc have doubled.\n\n\n\n\nIndia’s specialty chemicals\ncompanies are expanding their capacities to cater to rising demand from\ndomestic and overseas. With global companies seeking to de-risk their supply\nchains, which are dependent on China, the chemical sector in India has the\nopportunity for significant growth.\n \nMost Indian specialty chemical peers have\neither integrated their product portfolio or added downstream products in the\nrecent past, keeping their margins firm. On the other hand, the sharp rise in\ncontainer cost and its unavailability brings in trade challenges and margin\npressure. However stronger sales drive overall earnings momentum.\n \nIncreasing investments and spending to boost the growth\nA\nPetroleum, Chemicals, and Petrochemicals Investment Region are expected to attract investments worth\n7.63 lakh crores (US$ 104.36 Billion). Indian chemical companies spend ~1% of\ntheir revenue on R&D. An investment of 8 lakh crores (US$ 107.38 Billion)\nis estimated in the Indian chemical and Petrochemicals sector by 2025.\n\n\nThe rise in demand from end-user industries such as food processing, personal care, and home care is driving the development of different segments in India’s specialty chemicals market. The domestic chemicals sector’s small and medium enterprises are expected to showcase 18-23% revenue growth in FY 2021-22, owing to an improvement in domestic demand and higher realization due to high prices of chemicals. Around USD 17.1bn of petrochemical\nprojects of 9.2mn tonne products capacity are under implementation in India,\nwhich would help drive competitiveness of downstream chemicals industry due\nto availability of cheaper feedstock to cater to rising domestic demand.\n\n\nChemical Sector Report: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/10/disruption-in-china-beneficial-for.html\n\n\nSource: McKinsey Chemical Report\nSharekhan Research Report\nNirmal Bang Securitieses\nKotak Securities Chemical Report\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Recent disruption in China - Impact on Indian\nChemical Companies\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nSpecialty Chemical Article: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/07/speciality-chemicals-market-size-demand.html\nGovernment scheme to boost: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/07/government-initiatives-to-boost-growth.html\n\n\nIndian specialty chemicals companies are\npoised to ride tailwinds from macro drivers including ‘China+1’, import-substitution, growing costs within China (capital, operational, compliances), and currency benefits. Recent disruptions in China will cause medium-term challenges for downstream producers while benefiting base chemical suppliers. More importantly, these frequent supply disruptions in China further strengthen the case for quality Indian players in the chemical domain.\n\n\nGrowing import substitution by local industry makes a case for strengthening\nvolume growth for base chemical/intermediate suppliers. Recent disruptions in China (electricity\nshortages, targeted plant closures) open another round of challenges for\nalready stretched chemical supply chains globally and in India. China seems to\nbe targeting companies/industries with higher energy consumption intensity and\npolluting technologies. This is likely to drive volume shortages along with\nsignificant price spikes for key raw materials.\n\n\n\nIndian Specialty chemical\nindustry witnessed strong yoy demand and improved pricing scenario (led by\ncost-push) in general during Q2. Such a scenario couple with the covid impacted\nbase of last year makes the revenue trend strong. India has a small 4% of the\nglobal chemicals market that is growing at 5-6% in dollar terms. This suggests\nthat even a 15% CAGR in INR terms over the next 15 years would garner just an\n8% global market share. This is modest given the expected and strategic\nlowering of chemical exports by China (representing a 13-15% chunk of the\nglobal market).\n\n\n\n\nChina’s chemical\nindustry has shifted its focus to self-sufficiency and high value-added\nproducts\nThree\nphases of Chinese chemicals industry growth\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent developments further reiterate\nChina’s intent to not support capital inefficient and carbon inefficient\n(whether energy or emissions) businesses.

China seems to\nbe targeting companies/industries with higher energy consumption intensity and\npolluting technologies. This is likely to drive volume shortages along with\nsignificant price spikes for key raw materials.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;\"><div style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Indian Specialty chemical\nindustry witnessed strong yoy demand and improved pricing scenario (led by\ncost-push) in general during Q2. Such a scenario couple with the covid impacted\nbase of last year makes the revenue trend strong. India has a small 4% of the\nglobal chemicals market that is growing at 5-6% in dollar terms. This suggests\nthat even a 15% CAGR in INR terms over the next 15 years would garner just an\n8% global market share.

    "summary": "Syngene International Ltd. FY2020-21 Annual Report Key Takeaways\n\n\n In continuation of my previous blog here is the updated version link to Initial Blog - https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/10/syngene-next-giant-player-for-cdmo.html\n\n\nCompany Overview\nIncorporated in 1994 as a subsidiary of Biocon,\nSyngene International (SIL) is a leading contract research organization (CRO),\nwhich supports R&D programs of global innovative companies.\n \nSIL offers outsourced services to support discovery\nand development for organizations across industrial sectors like\npharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, animal health,\nagrochemicals, etc. It currently caters to 400+ global players including\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Abbott, Baxter, and Amgen, among others. SIL\nderives 95% of its revenues from exports.\n \nSyngene\ncontinued to build on its integrated drug discovery and development portfolio\nduring the year, including a five-year collaboration with 3DC, the drug\ndiscovery, and development subsidiary of Deerfield Management Company. Under\nthe agreement, the two companies will collaborate to advance therapeutic\ndiscovery projects, from target validation to pharmacological proof of concept\nand pre-clinical evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nSyngene is proud of its partnership with Albireo\nPharma as the work completed in our laboratories of advancing odevixibat from\npre-clinical supplies to regulatory filings in Europe and the US has put the\ncompound on track to become the first approved drug for PFIC3 patients. Other\nresearch projects which progressed during the year focused on leukemia,\nParkinson's disease, inflammatory disorders, fibrotic disorders, and orphan\ndiseases.\n \nDuring the year, the Company expanded its research\nfacility in Hyderabad by adding capacity for an additional 90 scientists. It\nalso commissioned a new microbial manufacturing facility during the year to\nreduce its dependency on external service providers.\n\n\nThe Company reported\nquarterly revenue from operations of Rs. 659 Cr and Rs. 2,184 Cr for the full\nyear. Underlying revenue from operations (excluding export incentives) for the\nquarter grew 13% compared with the same period last year and by 12% for the\nfull year. Profit after tax (before exceptional gain) for the quarter increased\nby 15% year-on-year to Rs. 138 Cr, and by 4% to Rs. 382 Cr for the full year.\n\n\n\nRapid Increase in Revenue -\nTrend over the Years\n\n\n\n\nThe company made meaningful progress on the\nstrategic development of the Company by adding to their Integrated Drug Discovery\nportfolio, expanding our footprint in Hyderabad, completing the qualification\nof our manufacturing site in Mangalore, and building our presence in the animal\nhealth sector.\n\n\n\nIncrease in number of Clients\n\n\n\nGrowth driven by an increase in sales from existing clients and acquisition of new clients. Engage, expand, and extend the strategy to extend client relationships over a longer period of time. Growth in the total number of clients Increase in average revenue from largest clients. Increase in the number of services offered to clients.\n\n\n\nCapital Expenditure\nCapex for the year was Rs. 4,669 Mn (USD 67 Mn), lower than planned by around 25% as they deferred certain projects due to the pandemic. Lower capex was also due to the release of additional capacity resulting from the introduction of shift working, especially in Discovery Services. \n\n\nOf the total capex, 15% was deployed in the API manufacturing facility, 31% in Discovery Services, 13% in the Biologics manufacturing facility and the remaining 40% in the Dedicated Centers, Development Services and common assets. Capex currently stands at Rs. 35,634 Mn (USD 510 Mn) as on March 31, 2021.\n\n\nIncrease in Scientist Count\n\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe year ahead offers positive prospects reflecting the strong fundamentals of the global biopharmaceutical industry against a backdrop of potential further disruption due to the second wave of the pandemic. The extension of their strategic collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb until 2030 will provide scope for new areas  of R&D within that relationship. \n\n\nThe company has initiated multiple expansion and capacity-building initiatives.The phase-III expansion of the Hyderabad laboratory is ongoing and will offer capacity for an additional 300 scientists.The company is collaborating with the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), under the National Biopharma Mission, to build a viral vector development and manufacturing plant for cell and gene therapy. \n\n\nThey added capacity to their mammalian cell biologics manufacturing capabilities as well as commissioned a new microbial facility, further enhancing their services in biologics. The Mangalore API plant has completed the qualification stage and beyond the GMP approval from the Indian regulator, they are working towards other regulatory approvals while adding clients and projects.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Ethanol - Global Production, Capacity, Impact, and Ethanol Blending Trend\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIn continuation with the previous Ethanol blog here is an extended version with more new Insights!\n\n\nWith a view to\ngive a boost to the agriculture sector and to reduce environmental pollution,\nthe government of India had launched pilot projects in 2001 wherein, 5% ethanol\nblended petrol was supplied to retail outlets. Apart from field trials, R&D\nstudies were also simultaneously conducted. The success of these field trials\nand studies paved the way for EBP in India. The Government of India vide its\nResolution dated 3rd September 2002 decided to launch Ethanol Blended Petrol\n(EBP) Program in January 2003 for sale of 5% ethanol blended petrol in nine\nStates and four UTs.\n \nThe global\nproduction of fuel ethanol touched 110 billion liters in 2019 showing an\naverage growth of 4% a year per year during the last decade. The United States of\nAmerica (USA) and Brazil contribute for 92 billion liters (84% of global share)\nfollowed by European Union (EU), China, India, Canada, and Thailand. In order to\nincrease the availability of ethanol for transport use, many initiatives have\nbeen taken by various countries across the world.\n\nCurrently the\nannual ethanol production capacity in India is around 6.5 billion liters. The majority of the ethanol production is based on sugary feedstock mainly cane\nmolasses and a small but growing proportion of starchy feedstock. Oil Marketing\nCompanies (OMCs) have contracted about 3.3 billion liters for the 2020-21 marketing\nyear, including about 0.4 billion liters from the starchy feedstock. \n\n\nThis would\nenable India to have ethanol blending of 8.5% for the ethanol supply year Dec\n2020- Nov 2021. India has recently announced the advancing of a 20% ethanol blending\ntarget by 5 years, from 2030 to 2025. This is expected to create the opportunity for\nadditional 10 billion liters per annum ethanol capacity.\n\n\n \nThe country’s recent move to allow the direct sale of\nethanol as a fuel for compatible automobiles is further expected to support the\nhigher ethanol demand. This will significantly create and build opportunities\nfor ethanol plant capacity expansion. Currently, the majority of the ethanol\nproduction in the country is dominated by three states namely Uttar Pradesh,\nMaharashtra and Karnataka produce ethanol using sugary feedstock.\n\n\n\nIn\na significant move to encourage countrywide ethanol production, India expanded\nthe basket of feedstock with the inclusion of starchy feedstock. Several enabling\nfactors such as interest subvention for projects, five-year buying visibility,\nupward price revisions, quick environmental clearance, etc. are introduced to\nattract investments in the sector.\n\n\nImpact on Consumer,\nvehicle manufacturer and component manufacturer by using Biofuel\n\n\nImpact on the\nconsumer\n1. Fuel\nEfficiency: While using E20 fuel, there will be a drop in fuel efficiency by\nnearly \n(a) 6-7% for 4 wheelers designed for E0 and calibrated for E10, \n(b) 3-4% for 2\nwheelers designed for E0 and calibrated for E10 \n(c) 1-2% for 4\nwheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. \n\n\nHowever, with the\nmodifications in engines (hardware and tuning), the loss in efficiency due to\nblended fuel can be reduced.\n\n\n2.

The ethanol industry structure in\nthe country is undergoing a radical shift with changes across dimensions of\nownership, feedstock, and geographical location for the production of ethanol.\n\n\n\nIndia’s\nrequirement of ethanol for petrol blending will increase from 173 crore liters\nin 2019-20 to 1,016 crore liters in 2025-26. To meet this demand, the ethanol\nproduction capacity will have to be increased from 684 crore liters in 2019-20\nto 1,500 crore liters in 2025-26. This includes a production capacity of (i) 740\ncrore liters of grain-based ethanol, and (ii) 760 crore sugar-based ethanol.\n\n\nMinistry of Petroleum and\nNatural Gas should notify a plan for availability of\nE10 fuel (blend of 10% ethanol and 90% petrol) by\nApril 2022. Further, the Ministry should notify a\nplan for the continued availability of fuel for older\nvehicles. Fuel blended with 20% ethanol (E20)\nshould be launched in a phased manner from April\n2023 to ensure availability of E20 by 2025. The\nrollout of higher ethanol blends may be done in a phased manner, starting with the states with surplus\nproduction of ethanol.\n\n\nSource: NITI Aayog\nPraj Industries Annual Report and Conferences\nBloomberg Quint\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Teleconsultation - The game-changer for the Animal Healthcare Industry\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nTelemedicine,\ntelehealth and teleconsulting are currently top of mind to the animal health\nand pet owners alike, however, leading veterinarians in the industry elaborated\nthat this digital offering of veterinary services has been on the rise for the past\nfive years and has only been accelerated with the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\nThe global veterinary telehealth market size was valued at USD 92.0 million in 2020 and is expected to expand at\na compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% from 2021 to 2028. The growing\nadoption of these management systems can be attributed to the steady growth in\nthe focus on veterinary telehealth along with disease detection.\n\nFurthermore, there is high demand\nand an increasing rate of consumption for animal-derived products is\nanticipated to drive the market. This growing demand is eventually increasing\nthe need to protect animals from diseases. Telehealth is the overarching term\nthat encompasses all uses of technology geared to remotely deliver health\ninformation or education. Telemedicine is the use of medical information\nexchanged from one site to another via electronic communications regarding a\npatient's clinical health status.\n\n\n\nSignificant revenue opportunity in multiproduct cross-selling\n\nSource: Teladoc Health\nGiven the current state of\ntechnological capabilities, available research, and the current state and federal\nregulatory landscape, the veterinary telemedicine should only be conducted\nwithin an existing Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR), with the\nexception for advice given in an emergency until that patient can be seen by a\nveterinarian.\n\n\nTelehealth can be divided into\ncategories based on who is involved in the communication. For communication\nbetween veterinarians and animal owners, there are two important categories that\nare distinguished by whether a VCPR has been established.\n\nWithout a VCPR, telehealth includes the delivery\nof general advice, educational information, and teletriage (to support the care\nof animals in emergency situations). Telemedicine includes the delivery of\ninformation specific to a particular patient and is allowable only within the\ncontext of an established VCPR.\n\n\nSource: American Veterinary Medica Association\nThe VCPR ensures that a veterinarian\nis readily available for follow-up evaluation, or has arranged for veterinary\nemergency coverage and continuing care and treatment. The veterinarian is\nexpected to provide oversight of treatment, compliance, and outcome, as well as\ndocument the patient’s continuing care and treatment in the medical record. The\nanimal owner’s consent for the use of telemedicine must also be obtained and\ndocumented.\n\n\n\nThe veterinary diagnostics segment is expected\nto witness a lucrative CAGR of 11.7% from 2021 to 2028. Various factors, such\nas the increasing number of veterinary practitioners & their incomes in\ndeveloped economies, growing animal health expenditure, and rising incidence of\nzoonotic diseases, are responsible for segment growth. Companies are investing\nin the expansion of their manufacturing facilities, which is expected to\npositively influence the market growth over the forecast period.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Grandview Research\n\n\nThe teleconsulting segment held\nthe majority of the revenue share of 29.1% in 2020. The segment growth is\nattributed to the rising usage among veterinarians to seek consultation from\nthe veterinary specialist via telehealth tools to gain advice and insights\nregarding the care of the animal. Further, teleconsultation saves\ntransportation costs and reduces ancillary expenses. Thus, expert advice can be\ntaken on an immediate basis without wasting the time for long waiting hours.\nSuch factors are propelling the segment market growth.\n\n\n\nThe key advantages of veterinary\ntelehealth such as saving transportation costs and reduction of ancillary\nexpenses are driving the growth of the market. In addition, the doctor's advice\nand virtual care can be obtained on an immediate basis. Further, it also saves\ntime as animal caretakers can skip the time consumed during long waiting hours.\nSuch factors are boosting the market growth.\n\n\nSource: Life MD+\n\nThere is increased adoption of animals\nby farmers and pet parents. This can be attributed to the increase in internet\npenetration and user-friendly animal healthcare websites or apps. Such factors\nare anticipated to increase the demand for veterinary telehealth over the\nforecast period. In addition, increasing cases of zoonotic diseases coupled\nwith the concern of owners about their animal health is also propelling the\ngrowth of the market.\n\nAccording to the survey results,\n64% of consumers showed an increased willingness to adopt teleconsultation\npost—Covid-19. On the other hand, doctors are also trying to reduce the\nnon-essential visits of the patients with approximately 80% of them being\nconsulted using informal means of consultation such as audio, video, and texts\nmessages through various apps.\n\nSource: American Animal Health Association\n\nTelemedicine is creating pathways for pet\nparents to engage with veterinarians, get advice, and obtain some level of\ntreatment with less friction. “The train has left the station in the adoption of\ntelemedicine or telehealth going forward. Pet parents have already seen that\nfor some cases, for triage or small questions, they can work with telemedicine\nfrom their armchair at the hours that they like.”\n\n\nThus, there is an immediate need for a strong regulatory framework in the interest of patients /consumers. As per the study,\nIndia’s e-pharmacy market is projected to reach 10%-12% of overall\npharmaceutical sales in the next five years driven by strong regulations,\nincreased funding and the creation of digital infrastructure. The pandemic has\nhighlighted the need to build a simplified and holistic teleconsultation\nplatform, guided by the robust regulatory and policy framework, encompassing\nall key stakeholders.\n\n\nLink to previous Animal Healthcare Articles:\n1.

    "summary": "Biotechnology the Natural Beauty Booster - Good for Health and Earth!\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nThe\napplications of biotechnology are so extensive that, currently, almost all\nindustries can use this technology. This means that these industries can\nproduce new or better products faster and more efficiently. Biotech beauty\ntechnically refers to ingredients that are generated with DNA editing and the\nhelp of organisms like algae, yeast, or bacteria. Biosynthesis is a multi-step,\nenzyme-catalyzed process where substrates are converted into more complex\nproducts in living organisms. In the biosynthesis stage, simple compounds are\nmodified, converted, or joined together to form macromolecules.\n\n\nCompounds like hyaluronic acid, squalane, and even collagen can be produced at high levels and in a completely pure and\nenvironmentally responsible way. In many ways, biotech can improve on what Mother Nature\nhas provided through evolution. Then the building blocks of organic compounds\nare isolated, chemical energy is simulated, and cells are fermented, which\ncauses them to multiply and grow. While these fermented cells, i.e., the\nbiosynthetic ingredients, are bioidentical to ingredients that live in nature,\nJay says their sustainability benefits are significant.\n\n\n\nA New Opportunity for the Industry\nThe global natural cosmetics market size was estimated at USD 34.12 billion in 2018 and is projected to\nregister a CAGR of 5.01% from 2019 to 2025 reaching at a valuation of USD 48.04\nbillion by 2025. Increasing demand for beauty\nproducts coupled with the rising awareness about environment-friendly products\nis expected to drive the growth. \n\n\nWith more consumers demanding\npotent but safe products and environmentally responsible beauty and wellness\nsolutions, K-beauty, and other major markets are already looking to biotech\ncompanies for new formulations of everything from hyaluronic acid to collagen. The sweet spot where biotech beauty is most valuable is that it combines sustainability, efficacy, and safety in one fell swoop.\n\n\nDriving forces of the cosmetics industry\nThe cosmetics industry will\nundergo a paradigm shift in overall product creation from basic research to\ndevelopment to marketing.\n\nIn basic research, biotechnology will become\nincreasingly more important due to advanced research in protecting skin from\naging. In the development stage, electronics, information technology, food, and medical technologies will intersect, leading to the development of converged\nproducts and solutions. In marketing, as consumers’ knowledge increases,\nadvertising highlighting research and development and stressing high-tech\nmaterials will be an appealing point rather than an emphasis on image.\n\n\n\n\nBiotechnology\nhas had an impact on cosmetics in several ways. Cosmetics companies use\nbiotechnology to discover, develop, and produce components of cosmetic\nformulations and to evaluate the activity of these components on the skin, in\nparticular, how they can affect the changes associated with aging. \n\n\nThus,\nbiotechnology represents a good alternative tool for developing active\ningredients that are able to slow down the aging process. In this review, we\nfocus on the description of all the active ingredients obtained through\nbiotechnological processes, found in the available literature.\n \nFermentation\nProcesses – Role in Beauty Biotechnology\nClassical\nbiotechnology is related to fermentation processes, which are defined as\noperations where microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, and some\nenzymes are used to obtain biotechnological products. Microorganisms have\nproved to be particularly useful owing to their ease of mass cultivation, speed\nof growth, use of cheap substrates, and the diversity of products they can\noriginate.\n\n\n\nIn\nmost industrial fermentation processes, there are several stages.

    "summary": "Telehealthcare - A game\nchanger for the Indian\nhealthcare\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\nIn the last few decades, India has made significant advancements in the way\nhealthcare has been delivered in the country. In the context of the COVID-19 public\nhealth emergency, the use of digital health technologies, including software as\na medical device or other digital therapeutics solutions may improve mental\nhealth and well-being of patients with psychiatric conditions during periods of\nshelter-in-place, isolation, and quarantine. In addition, by reducing patient\ncontact with, and proximity to, healthcare providers, can ease the burden on\nhospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals who are\nexperiencing increased demand due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\n\n\n1. Telehealth in India\nThe pandemic has highlighted the need to build a\nsimplified and holistic teleconsultation platform encompassing all key\nstakeholders. With the current levels of adoption by the patient–consumers and\ndoctors, along with emerging teleconsultation platforms, India has commenced\nits teleconsultation journey. The ‘Now’ has witnessed a massive expansion of\ntele–consulting as doctors and patients are restricted to interact in person.\nTelehealth and its Division\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Consumption of telehealth services in India\nIn\nresponse to the growing need for teleconsultation, pharmaceutical companies are\nalso proactively engaging with teleconsultation platform providers to establish\na connection between the doctors and the patients.\n\n\nSource: IPA\n\n\nTeleconsultation and e–pharmacy\nplatforms have shown steep growth in adoption by both,\ndoctors as well as patients. For e.g., Fortis Healthcare has\nwitnessed the shift in the outpatient department (OPD)\nconsultation with 10% of the pre–COVID-19 consultations\nmoving to the teleconsultation platform. \n\n\n3. Scope for Telemedicine in India\n\n\nWhat is Telemedicine?\nIt is the practice of medicine using technology\nto deliver healthcare services remotely. A registered physician at one location\nuses telecommunications infrastructure to deliver care to a patient at a\ndistant location.\n\n\n\nSource: IPA\n\nTelemedicine can play a particularly important role in cases\nwhere there is no need for the patient to physically see the RMP (or other\nmedical professional), e.g. for regular, routine check-ups or continuous\nmonitoring. Telemedicine can reduce the burden on secondary hospitals.\n\nThe telemedicine market in India is expected to\ngrow at a CAGR of 31% for the period 2020–25 and\nreach US$5.5b. Virtual care constitutes teleconsultation, telepathology,\nteleradiology, and e–pharmacy and is experiencing an encouraging stimulus in\nIndia was due to the pandemic. This stimulus has the potential to make\nteleconsultation and e-pharmacy account for ~95% of the telemedicine market by 2025\nwhich amounts to US$5.2 billion.\n\n\n5. Telemedicine Market Regionwise \n\n\n\nSource: GM Market research\n\nThe market value for the global telemedicine market has been\ncontinuously growing from $18.1 billion in 2015 to $30.5 billion as of 2019.\nThe market is forecast to expand to $35.5 billion this year and to $41.2\nbillion next year.\n\n6. Telemedicine in\nAnimal Healthcare\nU.S Veterinary telehealth market size, by service type 2016-2028 (USD Million)\n\n\n\nSource: Grandview Research\nTelemedicine, telehealth, and virtual care are recent\nbuzzwords in veterinary medicine, despite veterinarians practicing it for\nyears. Before the Coronavirus, the veterinary industry was slow to adopt\ntelehealth solutions. \n\n\nThere were numerous driving factors but the three main\nones that were heard over and over again was that pet owners did not have\nissues getting access to veterinarians, clinics did not equip to integrate\ntechnology into their offerings and veterinarians were concerned with\nliability surrounding remote consultations.\n\nThere has been a surge in adoptions around the\nworld for “Pandemic Puppies” and “Corona Kittens”. It is uncertain what the\neffects will be as pet owners return to work and children to school. There will\nhave to be a fundamental shift in business models for veterinarians.\n\n\n\nThe increasing prevalence of diseases such as diabetes,\nkidney diseases, spinal disc problems, and blood pressure related issues are\nfurther fueling the market for veterinary telehealth. \n\n7. Key\nFactors driving Telemedicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Factors Triggering the Growth of Telehealth Solutions\n\n\n\nThere is an increasing number of populations worldwide suffering from chronic disease. Moreover, the geriatric population and home healthcare have become a necessity in an urban environment.\nOn-demand healthcare apps and high\n     mobile penetration amongst every age group is another reason contributing\n     to the growth of telehealth solutions.\nTechnological advancements,\n     telehealth coverage in insurance is another factor fueling the growth of\n     telehealth solutions at the global level.\n\n\n\n9. Telemedicine – Enabler of Healthcare Access and Affordability\nThere are a number of benefits of telemedicine.

Further,\nit can be reasonably said that Medical Electronics is an area, where\nElectronics and Information Communication Technology play a decisive role.\n\n\nIndia is among the top 20 markets for medical devices\nworldwide and its medical devices market is expected to increase by a 35.4%\nCAGR to reach Rs. 352,450 (US$ 50 billion) in 2025 from Rs. 77,539 crore (US$\n11 billion) in 2020.\n\n\nThe medical devices sector in India comprises largely\nmultinationals, small and midsized companies.\nThe Government of India (GOI) has commenced various\ninitiatives to strengthen the medical devices sector, with emphasis on research\nand development (R&D) and 100% FDI for medical devices to boost the market.\n\n\nIndia\nhas a 75-80% import dependency on medical devices, with exports at Rs. 14,802\ncrore (US$ 2.1 billion) in 2019 and is expected to increase at a CARG of 29.7%\nto reach Rs. 70,490 crore (US$ 10 billion) in 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US, Germany, China, Brazil, Iran, etc., are a few key countries that import Indian medical devices. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu are the manufacturing hubs for medical devices in India.\n\n\nMedical devices consist of instruments, apparatus, machines,\nimplants, in-vitro reagents among others that are intended for use in the\ndiagnosis of other conditions. These devices are also used in the process of\ncure, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals. Large- and\nsmall-scale medical device companies play a role in the development of new\nmedical devices. Thus, owing to these developments medical device industry is\nprojected to witness significant growth in the upcoming years.\n\n\nThe rising number of medical facilities will boost the demand for\nmedical devices in the market. Various government initiatives such as ‘Production Linked\nIncentives (PLI) Scheme for Medica Devices 2020’ and establishing medical parks\nwill augment demand.\nThe Indian medical device is driven by 75- 80% imports from\ncountries such as the US, China, and Germany.\n\n\nThe\ngovernment is planning to develop/create a manufacturing base for medical\ndevices in India and encourage exports, as it recognizes this sector as a\nsunrise sector.\n\n\n\n\nMajor\nInvestments in Medical Sector\nThe medical Device sector has attracted significant investments over the\nyears. The government plans to invest significantly in establishing medical devices\nparks in four states of India - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and\nKerala. \n\n\n100% FDI will boost investments from private companies in\nthis sector to further incentivize investments in the manufacturing of medical\ndevices, in May 2020, the Central Government of India announced incentivization\nplans of at least Rs. 3,420 crore (US$ 4.9 billion) over a period of five\nyears and these funds will be offered to manufacturers only if they invest in\nset-ups to produce key medical devices. \n\n\nIn May 2020, AiMeD (an Umbrella Association of Indian\nManufacturers of Medical Devices) invited Japanese investors who were\ninterested in setting up a manufacturing base for medical devices (including\nmedical electronics & IVD) in India. As a part of the initiative, India is\ntargeting 1200 technical collaborations with Indian investors for JPY 600\nbillion (US$ 5746.7 million) and above, 200 joint ventures with foreign\ninvestors for JPY 200 billion (US$ 1903.8 million) and above, and 50 MNCs for\nJPY 200 billion (US$ $ 1903.8 million) and above.\n\n\nIn September 2020, Thiruvananthapuram-based Sree Chitra\nTirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology announced that it will\ncollaborate with the Kerala government to set up an Rs. 260 crore (US$ 35.44\nmillion) medical devices park in Thonnakkal (Thiruvanthapuram).\nSources: GMinsights\n-IBEF\n-KPMG\n-Nureca\n-Polymedicure\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "India's Growth Trajectory in Chemical Sector supported by Government Initiatives\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nThe global chemicals market is valued\nat around USD 4,738 billion and is expected to grow at 6.2% CAGR reaching USD\n6,400 billion by 2024. The Indian chemicals market is valued at USD 166 billion\n(~4% share in the global chemical industry) and it is expected to reach ~USD\n280-300 Bn in the next 5 years, with an anticipated growth of ~12% CAGR. The\nspecialty chemical industry forms ~47% of the domestic chemical market, which\nis expected to grow at a CAGR of around 11-12% over the same period.\n\n\nStronger\ngrowth lead by Government Initiatives\nIndia’s\ngrowth story was largely positive based on the strength of domestic absorption\nand the economy was registering a steady pace of economic growth pre-Covid.\nMoreover, its other macroeconomic parameters like inflation, fiscal deficit and\ncurrent account balance had exhibited distinct signs of improvement. Though the\npandemic has led to a short-term slowdown of the economy, the medium-long term\nfundamentals are sound & India is expected to witness the revival of its\neconomy soon.\n\n\n\nAatmanirbhar\nBharat Abhiyan\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on May\n12, 2020 announced the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan which combined relief,\npolicy reforms and fiscal and monetary measures to help businesses and\nindividuals to cope with the situation created by the pandemic and helps\ntransform India into a self-reliant economy. The government seized the crisis to\npush forward long-pending industrial & other economic reforms in the least politically resistant atmosphere.\n\n• This campaign is especially expected\nto benefit the Specialty chemicals sector, with several players hoping to\nposition themselves as an alternative to China as the coronavirus crisis\nprompts companies to diversify their supply chains.\n\n• Govt. announced a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the promotion and manufacturing of pharmaceutical\nraw materials in India. The government’s move is aimed to boost domestic manufacturing and cut dependence on imports of critical Active Pharmaceutical\nIngredients (APIs).\nFurther, the government has also decided to develop three\nmega bulk drug parks in partnership with states. These schemes will likely appeal\nmore to the smaller players and should foster more investments. The government\nis soon planning to roll out such a scheme for the chemicals sector as well.\n\n• The government is also in the\nprocess of launching a production-linked incentive (PLI) for the chemical\nsector to increase self-reliance in the country. This move is to reduce the country’s\ndependency on imports of basic chemicals. The PLI scheme will help the sector\nto identify import-dependent chemicals and work towards producing them within\nthe country.\n\n\n\n• Specialty\nchemical companies will look at import substitution along with export\nopportunities to further drive their business. Historically, domestic\nconsumption has been the driving metric for Specialty chemicals manufacturing\nin India, with exports playing a much smaller part – owing to reduced raw\nmaterial availability, higher utility tariffs, and a stricter regulatory\nstructure. However, owing to the current geopolitical issues, India’s focus on\nbeing a manufacturing hub for exports of specialty chemicals will increase,\nsubsequently increasing the share of exports in the overall market.\n\n\n\nGlobal\nchemicals market, 2014, 2019, and 2024F (USD 4100 Bn, USD 4738 Bn, and USD 6400\nBn)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Chemicals\nThe commodity chemicals market includes companies that manufacture basic chemicals in large volumes. These include plastics, synthetic fibers, films, certain paints and pigments, explosives, and petrochemicals. There is limited product differentiation within the sector; products are sold for their composition.\nThe commodities market is highly fragmented. The\nend-user markets include other basic chemicals, specialties, and other chemical\nproducts; manufactured goods such as textiles, automobiles, appliances, and\nfurniture; and pulp and paper processing, oil refining, aluminum processing,\nand other manufacturing processes. Markets also include some non-manufacturing\nindustries. The sector is presently valued at ~USD 3,700 Bn and is expected to grow\nat 5%-6% globally in the next five years.\n\n\n\nSpecialty Chemicals\nThe specialty chemicals market is characterized by high value-added, low volume\nchemical production. These chemicals are used in a wide variety of products,\nincluding fine chemicals, additives, advanced polymers, adhesives, sealants and\nspecialty paints, pigments, and coatings. The specialty market is extremely fragmented.\nThe consolidation of companies has been a major trend and is expected to\ncontinue. Similar to the commodity sector, the specialty sector is affected by the high costs of energy and feedstock.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers across the Industries\nThe\nCOVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy.\nChemical companies in North America\nand Europe have specifically started focusing on operational efficiency, asset\noptimization, and cost management. On a short-term basis, most companies are\nconsidering implementing a series of targeted, strategic initiatives across\nmajor functional areas such as R&D and technology. \nCompanies are also keen\non addressing long-term opportunities like investing in innovation, emerging\napplications, adopting new business models that generate sustained growth,\nanalyzing temporary vs. permanent customer buying behavior patterns across geographies.\n\nThe industry is expected to see the following trends in the next 2-5 years - \n• Companies\nwill try and shift their focus toward new value streams and growing end\nmarkets, such as health care and electronics\n\n• Most\ngovernments have announced policy proposals related to regulation, trade, and\nsustainability which could prove beneficial in shifting the dependence of the\nindustry from China\n\n• Chemical companies are now experiencing\nsignificant changes in the way they operate and serve their customers by\nleveraging on remote and digital sales channels.\n\n\nGrowth from various Industries are as follows:\n\n\n\nOwing to shutdowns in China and lack of capacity\nadditions in other developed countries, India stands to benefit in the export\nmarket. Also supporting the growth in India is its ability to manufacture at a\nlower price compared with its western counterparts. Moreover, the specialty\nchemicals consumption in the country is low compared with the global average.\nThe increasing availability of basic chemicals is likely to support investments\nin the specialty chemicals segment further.\n\n\n\nThe “Make in India” campaign is\nalso expected to add impetus to the emergence of India as a manufacturing hub for\nthe chemicals industry in the medium term. Through incentives, subsidies and\ngrants under this campaign, Indian companies could gain further ground as\ncompanies would want to reduce dependence on China after the COVID-19 pandemic\nand shift their supply chains. \n\n\nThe decline in raw materials prices could also\nhelp the margins and reduce the working capital needs. However, input costs are a\npass-through for most companies and benefits could be limited. Overall, the chemicals industry is likely to continue to perform well in the near\nto medium term and is expected to capitalize on the Make in India benefits to\nassume a leadership position in the Global markets.\n\n\nList of Chemical Companies:\n1. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/03/neogen-chemicals-ltd-agro-chemical.html\n2. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/02/dmcc-dharamsi-morarji-chemical-company.html\n3. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/02/tata-chemicals-huge-opportunities-ahead.html\n4. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/03/deepak-nitrite-leading-indian-producer.html\n\n\nSources: \n\n Indian Chemical sector - Presentation\nFrost & Sullivan Indian Chemical Report\nKPMG Report on Speciality Chemicals\nPWC Speciality Chemicals\nAvendus Speciality Chemical\nIBEF\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Specialty Chemicals what makes them so demanding?\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nSpecialty chemicals are particular chemical products that\nhelp in providing a variety of effects to various industries that they cater to\nsuch as textile, ink additives, construction, oil & gas, cosmetics, and\nfood. Specialty chemicals can be single-chemical formulations or entities whose\ncomposition greatly influences the performance of the customers’ products. These\nchemicals are used on the basis of their function and performance. Continuous\nR&D in this market has facilitated the development of products with optimum and\nadvanced features. This is one of the major factors that drive the growth of\nthis market.\n\nWith the easing of lockdown norms, there has been a good recovery\nin overall operations of the Indian specialty chemical sector but it’s believed\nthat full normalcy would still take some time especially for industrial\nchemicals. \n\nTo seize the opportunity to establish India as a\nleading chemicals & petrochemicals manufacturing hub, with a thrust on\nreduction in import dependency by attracting investments for manufacturing\nquality products using cutting-edge technologies in specified clusters with\nfocus on sustainability contributes to the manufacturing sector of USD 5 Trillion\nIndian Economy.\n\n\nGlobal Speciality Chemical Market Size\n\n\n\nThe global Specialty Chemicals market size is pegged at\n~USD805b. It is expected to post a ~6.4% CAGR to USD1,170b by CY25. Globally,\n~25% of the total specialty chemicals production is exported, amounting to\n~USD200b. The EU and the US have historically been key global specialty\nchemical hubs. However, after CY08, the focus has shifted to China, facilitated\nby lower labor costs, government subsidies, and relaxed environmental norms.\nChina dominates with ~36% share in the global Specialty Chemicals space, with\nexports worth USD35b in CY19 (i.e., ~4x that of India). However, the high\neconomic growth seen in China has come at a very heavy environmental cost.\nInvestments in environmental protection have failed to keep pace with the rapid\nadvancement in the economy. \n\n\n\nChina has now issued various environmental protection norms\nand taken the necessary steps to ensure a sustainable environment – within\nwhich the economy could grow without damaging the environment. Geopolitical\nissues: In Jun’18, the US announced the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports.\nThis event not only impacted the pricing of goods but also capital spending by\nchemical majors. The US-China trade war resulted in supply uncertainties in\nwestern countries. De-risking from a single concentrated source (i.e., China)\npresents an opportunity for countries such as India.\n\nIndia is one of the fastest-growing countries globally -\naverage GDP growth of 7% in the last 20 years. India’s National Income is growing\nat a CAGR of 11%, Will be among the 5 largest world economies by 2025. India\nwill surpass China and become the most populous country by 2023.\n\nFavorable\ndemographics – world’s largest youth population. India is on the move: Cities\nare likely to house 42.5% of the Indian Population by 2025. Huge domestic market: The urban market shall account for 2/3rd of consumption growth by 2025. Produce\ncloser to market.\n\nSignificant improvements in infrastructure –\nports, roads, airports, railways, telecom. The Ease of Doing Business ranking\nof India has improved from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019.\n\n\n\nIncrease in demand for Chemicals &\nPetrochemicals\nIndia is\npoised to emerge as a global chemical and petrochemical manufacturing hub. The government of India has launched flagship programs such as Make in India and\nthe Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to provide much-needed support to this sector\nand create a facilitative environment to attract further investments.\n\nProduction Linked\nIncentive Scheme for the manufacturing sector\n\nThe objective of the PLI Scheme\n·       1. Competitive & efficient domestic\nmanufacturing.\n        2. Attract investment in core sectors & cutting-edge technologies.\n        3. Make India part of the global supply chains.\n        4. Enable economies of scale and exports.\n\n\n        Impact and benefits of the scheme\n·     The minimum production in the country as the outcome of the PLI scheme stands to be around USD 56 billion in the next 5\nyears.\n·      Cashback and incentives between 2% and 20% of\nthe incremental sales revenue (over the base year) and incremental exports\nrevenue depending on the sector.\n·      Potential to create ~14 million man-months’\nworth of jobs directly from 2021-22.\n \nPLI Scheme Outlay for 10 Sectors (USD\nbillion)\n\n\n\nImport\nand export of chemicals and petrochemicals for FY16–20 (in USD billion)\n\n\nSource: Ministry of Commerce\n\nThe\nspecialty chemicals segment has grown at an impressive rate of approximately\n11.7% in terms of value in the last five years. The COVID-19 pandemic had a\npositive impact on the demand for flavors and fragrances, personal care\nchemicals, nutraceutical ingredients, and surfactants as a result of increased\nconsumption of hygiene products, packaged foods, energy drinks and\nnutraceuticals. The segment has immense growth potential due to the increasing\ndemand from construction, automotive, packaging, water treatment, home and\npersonal care, food processing, nutraceuticals, and other demand-driven sectors.\n\n\n\nIn addition\nto the industry’s historic growth trajectory, the Government has taken\nprogressive steps, such as the economic stimulus package, Production Linked\nIncentive (PLI) Scheme, tax and labor reforms, setting up of the National\nInfrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and various chemical industry-specific policies\nand schemes, including its public procurement policy, mandatory BIS standards,\nskill development programs and renewal of the PCPIR policy.\n\n\nThe Indian chemical industry has tremendous\npotential and a positive outlook, and is set to achieve the USD 300 billion\nmark by FY25 and emerge as a global manufacturing hub.\n\n\nSource: Indian Chemical sector - Presentation\nKPMG Report on Speciality Chemicals\nPWC Speciality Chemicals\nAvendus Speciality Chemical\nIBEF\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "What's driving the Ethanol madness? \n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIn terms of\nsource, the Indian ethanol market has been categorized into sugar &\nmolasses-based ethanol, second-generation (mixed grains) and grain-based\nethanol. The energy demand in our country is rising due to an expanding\neconomy, growing population, increasing urbanization, evolving lifestyles, and\nrising spending power. Based on application, the market has been segmented into\nindustry solvent, fuel & fuel additive, beverages, disinfectant, personal\ncare, and flavouring & fragrance. The target of achieving 20% Ethanol blending by 2030 has been revised to be achieved by 2025.\n\n\n\n\nAbout 98%\nof the fuel requirement in the road transportation sector is currently met by\nfossil fuels and the remaining 2% by biofuels. Today, India imports 85% of its\noil requirement. The Indian economy is expected to grow steadily despite\ntemporary setbacks due to the COVID pandemic.\n\n\nDomestic\nbiofuels provide a strategic opportunity to the country, as they reduce the\nnation’s dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, when utilized with\nappropriate care, biofuels can be environmentally friendly, sustainable energy\nsources. They can also help generate employment, promote Make in India, Swachh\nBharat, doubling of farmers’ incomes and promote Waste to Wealth generation.\n\n\n\nThis would\nresult in a further increase of vehicular population which in turn will\nincrease the demand for transportation fuels. Domestic biofuels provide a\nstrategic opportunity to the country, as they reduce the nation’s dependence on\nimported fossil fuels. In addition, when utilized with appropriate care,\nbiofuels can be environmentally friendly, sustainable energy sources.\n\n\nBiofuel Manufacturing Process\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth in Biofuels\nThe Indian government announced a multi-year plan to increase the blending of ethanol in\nautomotive fuel. This was done with the objective of moderating imports and\nvehicular emissions. What made the industry sit up and take notice was that\nthis did not merely entail an announcement of intent it was backed by growing year-on-year\nprocurement by the country’s oil marketing companies. These oil marketing\ncompanies procured 173 crore litres of ethanol from sugar companies for onward blending\nduring 2019-20.\n\n\n\nBelow the table provides the country-wise prices of ethanol:\n\n\n\nThe prices\nof ethanol produced in India are higher in comparison to global players, since\nthe cost of raw materials viz. sugarcane and food grains are fixed by the\ngovernment to support the farming community. Globally, the three major factors\ndrive the production of ethanol and its usage in the transportation sector,\nnamely :\n\n\n1. Demand\nEnrichment: Governments’ mandate for blending a minimum percentage (%) of\nethanol with gasoline fuel & production of ethanol compatible vehicles. \n2. Supply\nEnrichment: Schemes for ethanol production from different feedstocks and\nencouragement to augment bio-refineries and their capacities. \n3.\nIncentives: Promoting the use of higher ethanol blends through price incentives\n(tax relief at the retail level) and tax incentives for vehicles compatible\nwith E20 and E85.\n\n\nFuel Ethanol Demand in India\nEthanol\n(also called ethyl alcohol, or alcohol) is an organic chemical compound with the chemical formula C2 H5 OH. Besides the EBP Programme, ethanol finds competitive\nusage in the portable sector and the chemical & pharmaceutical industry.\nDemand for ethanol as a fuel is primarily driven by blending mandates, the widespread availability of fuel, and compatible vehicles and fulfilment of\nother infrastructural requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability of feed-stocks for production of ethanol \nTo produce\n684 crore litres of ethanol by the sugar industry by 2025-26, sugarcane\nequivalent to 60 LMT of surplus sugar would be diverted to ethanol. In the\ncurrent sugar season, 2020-21 more than 20 LMT of sugar is estimated to be diverted.\nTo produce 666 crore litres of ethanol/ alcohol from food grains by 2025-26,\nabout 165 LMT of food grains would be utilized.\n \nAt present\ndamaged food grain availability is around 40 lakh ton in the country. In\n2020-21 approximately 20 lakh ton maize is surplus; FCI Rice is also sufficient\nin stock (266 LMT) and it will continue to remain robust as procurement of\npaddy/rice at MSP continues at expected levels. The country is producing\nsufficient food grains and sugar to meet the requirement for ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimation of supply and capacity augmentation \nDuring\nthe meeting of the Committee of Secretaries on 13th November 2020, DFPD informed that the\nfuel 20% ethanol requirement by 2025 will be met from sugar as well as grains\nsectors. The chart below provides the Year-wise and Sector-wise Ethanol Production\nProjections as per increasing Blending Percentages.\n\n\n\n\nThe\ngrains and molasses-based ethanol production capacity necessary to meet the\nproduction projections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe central\ngovernment is expecting investments of up to Rs 41,000 crore to help India\nachieve its ethanol blending target of 10% by 2022 and 20% by\n2025. This investment is likely to arrive as capacity addition\nfor ethanol-producing distilleries in addition to building new ones.\n \nWith a view\nto achieve blending targets, DFPD is making concerted efforts to enhance the\nethanol distillation capacity in the country. For this, the government had\ninvited applications from the entrepreneurs under the ethanol interest\nsubvention schemes in September 2020 during a window of 30 days. Thus far, 238\nprojects for a capacity enhancement of 583 Cr litres with a loan amount of\nabout Rs.16,000/- crore have been approved by DFPD. It is expected that at\nleast 400 Cr litres capacity would be added to these projects by 2024.\n\n\n\nThere is an estimate that an ethanol demand of 1016 cr. litres based on expected growth in\nvehicle population. Modelling exercise on expected penetration of electric\nvehicles estimate the ethanol demand for petrol blending in the range of\n722-921 crore litres in 2025. Prime Minister mentioned, 5,000 compressed biogas\nplants will be set up by 2024 with a production target of 15 million tonnes. \n\n\nEthanol demand, market outlook: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/05/ethanol-demand-market-size.html\n\nEnzyme Biotechnology: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/12/what-are-enzyme-biotechnology-market.html\nIndia towards Biobased economy: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/05/biotechnology-way-towards-bio-based.html\nBiotechnology Industry Overview: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/05/indias-biotechnology-industry-size.html\n\n\nSources & Credits: \n- NITI Aayog\n- iied\n- Company reports\n- Business Standards\n- Bloomberg Quint\n-aimspress\n-chemanalyst\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

By 2025, the contribution\nof the Indian biotechnology industry in the global biotechnology market is\nexpected to grow to 19% from 3% in 2017.\n\n\nBio-services,\nwhich accounted for 15% of the biotechnology industry in India, is becoming a\nleading destination for clinical trials, contract research, and manufacturing\nactivities in the country.\n\n\n\n\n• In FY20, the sector grew 15% year on year\n• By FY24, the contribution of the Indian biotechnology industry in the global biotechnology market is expected to grow to 19% from 3% in FY18\n• India has over 4237+ biotech startups and is expected to have over 10,000 by 2025. \n• There are 760+ core biotech companies with 200+ Biotech products available in the Indian market\n• There are 55+ Bio-incubators with an approximate Incubation space of 591,349+ sq ft across India supporting 1000 Incubatees\n• There are 9 Biotechnology Parks and 4 Biotechnology Science Clusters across India\n• 3rd largest in the Asia Pacific\n• India is the world’s largest producer of recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine\n• India holds 3% of the global market share in Biotechnology.\n• By 2025, the Indian Biotechnology industry is expected to reach $150 bn from $70 bn in 2020\n• Fast-developing clinical capabilities with the country are helping it become a popular destination for clinical trials, contract research, and manufacturing activities.\n• Increasing government expenditure is likely to augment growth in the biotechnology industry.\n\n\n\nRobust Demand\n•    India’s billion-plus population base offers a huge market for biotech products & services.\n•    Increasing economic prosperity and health\nconsciousness will continue to fuel the demand for healthcare services in India.\n•      Better accessibility to healthcare services further\naccelerates the demand and helps in the growth of biotechnology in India.\n\n\nInnovative Opportunities\n •     Public funding is being offered for product innovation\nand research in the biotech sector. The private sector has been aggressively pursuing focused R&D. The public-Private partnership model will improve the\nmarket with innovative research and developments.\n\n\n\n\nNational Biotechnology Development Strategy-2015-2020\n •   Launch of Four Major Missions – Healthcare, Food, and Nutrition,\nClean Energy and Education\n •  Creating a Technology Development and Translation\nnetwork across the country with global partnership-5 new clusters, 40 Biotech\nincubators, 150 TTOs, 20 Bio connect centers.\n •   Strategic and focused investment in building the Human\nCapital by creating a Life Sciences and Biotechnology Education Council.\n  •   In the Union Budget, the Department of Biotechnology\nhas seen a hike in the allotment and been given ₹3,502 crores. Last year, it spent\n₹2,300 crores and was budgeted ₹2,786 crores.\n\n\n\nRamping up Service Offering\n  •    Companies are evolving their product mix to reflect the growing repertoire in Biologics, Branded Formulations, and Research Services\n  •   The state will accord the units coming under the biotech sector with the industry status and aims to establish an\ninternationally competitive business infrastructure and environment for the biotech industry in the state. Biocon\nhas emerged as the leading player in bioproducts.\n\n\nEnablers\nfor boosting research and innovation and strengthening the entire ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Initiatives\nConsidering immense growth potential, biotechnology has been chosen as one of the champion\nsectors in the Make in India initiative. Funds and infrastructure support have been\ncommitted under the start-up India initiative. To provide for specialized\nfacilities required for biopharma research and innovation, the government has\nestablished incubators and parks for start-ups. The Department of Biotechnology\n(DBT) has set up nine biotechnology parks and incubators that offer facilities\nto scientists and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for technology\nincubation, technology demonstration, and pilot studies. \n\n\n      Biotechnology\nIndustry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has supported 50 bio-incubators\nacross the country since 2014 to nurture the ecosystem. It has also set up four\nregional centers to foster and facilitate bio-entrepreneurship and mentor\nbio-entrepreneurs for transforming innovative biotech ideas into successful and\nsustainable ventures. The Technology Development Board has funded 36 Technology\nBusiness Incubators (TBIs) and Science & Technology Entrepreneur Parks\n(STEPs) under Seed Support System for start-ups in Incubators.\n\nBiotech Companies poised with external funding to boost the growth\nOverall, there are more than 3,500 recombinant\nproteins and antibodies in pre-clinical and clinical trials and launched\ntreatment. A growing number of molecules in the pipeline are being developed by\nsmall and virtual biotech companies. Those do not normally have the in-house\nmanufacturing capacity and expertise to bring their candidates to market and\ntherefore have a higher propensity to outsource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Currently, these emerging biopharma\ncompanies constitute approximately 80% of the development pipeline. Biotech\ncompanies are outsourcing more than 70% of their development and manufacturing\nservice needs to external partners. Among smaller biotechs, this number reaches\nbetween 90 and 100%, as secured funding is used for developing therapies in\npreference to building in-house manufacturing for clinical-stage trials. Biotech companies with a strong manufacturing\npartner can receive improved funding, setting up a positive feedback loop. VC\nfunds have also begun to establish their own virtual biotech companies.\n\n\nPharma & Biotech Contribution to the Value Chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The path from preclinical testing to\napproval usually takes a decade or longer, with no promise of success.\nAccording to the Biotechnology\nInnovation Organization, approximately one in ten drugs entering\nclinical testing ultimately make to the markets. The highest rate of failure\noccurs in Phase II, only 31% of drugs proceed to Phase III. \n      \n      Of those that make\nit to the final Phase III, a little more than half 58% are considered safe and\neffective enough for an NDA or BLA submission. From start to finish, only 10%\nof the drugs that begin Phase-I reach the market. Despite the low odds, innovative\ncompanies continue to bring new drugs to market every year. India's biotechnology industry has a\npromising future with huge opportunities and it seems like an attractive prospect for future private\ninvestments.\n\n\nSources: Lonza Pharma& BIOTECH\nCatalent\nBiocon\nIndia's Biotechnology Department\nBIRAC\nIBFC \nGlobal Bio India 2021\n\n\nLink to Biocon Ltd. company overview: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/10/biocon-ltd-blockbuster-for-biologics.html\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Biotechnology – The way towards a Biobased\neconomy\nBiotechnology companies have developed to form\nbackbone support to the economy of the nation. The bio-economy includes all\nactivities related to the production of biomass and the ways in which the\nbiomass and its residues can be used subsequently.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Biotechnology \nThere is growing consumer demand for natural\nproducts, low-carbon solutions, and bio-based innovation. Industrial\nbiotechnology is a key enabling technology for delivering these solutions. At\nthe same time, there is a huge opportunity for biotechnology aligned with\nAgriculture & chemical sectors.\n\n\nHowever, in the modern financial\nworld, biotechnology companies comprise an industry sector collectively known\nas the biotech. The research, develop, and produce a wide variety of\ncommercial products, though most of them focus on medical or agricultural\napplications.\n\n\n\n\nGreen\nBiotechnology (Agricultural Biotechnology) – Huge growth opportunities ahead\nGreen Biotechnology is the use of\ngenetically altered plants or animals to produce more environmentally-friendly\nfarming solutions as an alternative to traditional agriculture, horticulture,\nand animal breeding processes.\nA\ngreen biorefinery processes (wet) green biomass, such as grass, clover,\nalfalfa or immature cereals. The first step involves fractionation of the\ngreen biomass into a nutrient-rich juice “Organic Solution” and a fiber-rich\nlignocellulosic press cake. This is typically performed mechanically in a screw\npress. Both intermediates are starting points for various valorization pathways.\n\n\n\nGreen biotechnology has various use of\nenvironmentally friendly solutions as an alternative to traditional industrial\nagriculture, horticulture, and animal breeding processes.\nUse\n     of bacteria to facilitate the growth of plants\nUse\n     of plants to remove heavy metals such as lead, nickel, or silver, which\n     can then be extracted (\"mined\") from the plants\nGenetic\n     manipulation to allow plant strains to be frost-resistant\nUse\n     of genes from soil bacteria to genetically alter plants to promote\n     tolerance to fungal pathogens\nEngineering\n     of plants to express pesticides\nDevelopment\n     of pest-resistant grains\nUse\n     of bacteria to assure better crop yields instead of pesticides and\n     herbicides\nProduction\n     of superior plants by stimulating the early development of their root\n     systems\nUse\nof bacteria to get plants to grow faster, resist frost, and ripen earlier.\n\nWhen pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncome concurrently, it results in the betterment of humankind. It works\ndifferently for every patient; the dosages shall be given according to the\npatient’s genetic, as prescribed by the doctor.\nBiotechnology\nfor Bio Fuels\nBiofuels are alternative fuels made from plant\nand plant-derived resources. Biofuels are used mainly for transportation. There\nare two types of biofuels: bioethanol and biodiesel.\n\n\nBioethanol, the principal fuel used as\nsubstitute for petrol for road transport vehicles is mainly produced by the the sugar fermentation process of cellulose (starch), which is mostly derived from\nmaize and sugar cane. Biodiesel on the other hand is mainly produced from oil\ncrops such as rapeseed, palm, and soybean.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Scenario\nfor Growth\nIn\nthe year 2020 the global biotechnology market size was valued at USD 752.88\nbillion and is expected to expand at a (CAGR) of 16% from 2021 to 2028. The\nmarket is driven by favorable government initiatives owing to the growth of the the biotechnology sector in developing countries, such as India and China.\n\n\n\nIn addition, in 2019, small molecules\ndominated the pharmaceutical compounds pipeline with around 22 U.S. FDA\napprovals as compared to eight large molecules (biotech).

    "summary": "Ethanol - The next big tailwind story\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nIntroduction\nEthanol, also\ncalled ethyl alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol is simple alcohol\nthat is often abbreviated as EtOH. Ethanol production in India is mainly\ndominated by sugary feedstock, and C-heavy molasses available from sugar mills. Ethanol\nproduced by fermentation of renewable food crops such as sugarcane, maize,\nwheat, sorghum, beet, and other starches is called bioethanol, and it is the eco-friendly\nalternative biofuel. The product is primarily used as a solvent in various\nindustries such as:\n\n\nIn addition,\nethanol is gaining popularity as an efficient alternative fuel. It has\nsignificant penetration in the major end-use industries such as automotive,\nfoods and beverages, chemicals, personal care and cosmetics, and\npharmaceuticals. According to the reports, the global ethanol market is\nprojected to grow at a robust CAGR of 4.5% to reach USD 117 Billion by the end\nof 2027. The primary factors favoring the growth of the global ethanol market are\nthe increasing demand for the product in the rapidly growing end-use industries\nsuch as automotive, food and beverages, and chemicals.\n\n\nIn Chemistry terms, ethanol or\nethyl alcohol is the 2nd member in the family of molecules\ncontaining OH (hydroxyl) group attached to a carbon atom, with the chemical\nformula C2H5OH. This molecule has three widely known\napplications –\n\n\nAs fuel ethanol where is mixed\nwith gasoline as an oxygenate to boost octane number and in higher proportions,\nto replace gasoline. As beverage alcohol where is the principal component of\nalcoholic beverages like whiskey, rum, and vodka. In industrial applications like\npaints, varnishes, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, industrial solvents,s, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nSugar\nProcess Flow chart\n\n\n\nIn a fermentation process sugar (glucose, fructose or other monosaccharides) is converted to ethanol by microbes (mostly varieties of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which are inoculated to the feedstock. The monosaccharides originate either directly from disaccharides, which are broken up via invertase enzymes, or from starch which is hydrolyzed with amylase enzymes. In addition to ethanol, water and carbon dioxide are produced also.\n\n\nThe feedstock for ethanol production can be any material containing appreciable amounts of sugar or substances that can be converted to sugar. Conventional production uses sugar (from sugar cane and sugar beet), starch (from corn, wheat, or potatoes), or other polysaccharides. The production process of second-generation ethanol, also called cellulosic alcohol, uses cellulosic feedstock (e.g. from agricultural residues) which requires further pretreatment.\n\n\nHuge\nrunaway for Growth\nThe total annual installed capacity of Ethanol in India is 460 Cr. L In the next 5 yrs, OMCs Ethanol\nrequirement will be ~2000-2400 Cr. Lts as per 10% Ethanol blending India has a target of achieving 10% Ethanol blending by 2022 & 20% Ethanol blending by\n2030.\n\n\n\nIndia has preponed the target of\nachieving 20% ethanol-blending with petrol by five years to 2025 as it looks to\ncut dependence on costly oil imports. In 2014, less than 1% ethanol was being\nblended with petrol against the target of 5%. In the last sugar year, this\nratio has reached 8.5% and next year it is 10%, Last year the government had\nset a target of reaching 10% ethanol-blending by 2022 (10% of ethanol mixed\nwith 90% of petrol) - and 20% by 2030. \"But now the 20% target has been\nadvanced to 2024-25.\n\nWhen the nation achieves that ratio of blending,\nIndia will be second only to Brazil in blending ethanol in petrol. But in\nabsolute terms, India will be higher than Brazil. India is 83% dependent on\nimports for meeting its oil needs. Doping petrol with ethanol will cut down the\nimport requirement. Also, ethanol being less polluting fuel, it will cut down\ncarbon emissions.\n\n\nSource: ISMA\n\nGovernment Recent Policy\nto augment the growth\n\nThe government has announced the 5 year tender for procurement. There's a big push\non the ethanol side. High interest for grain-based ethanol plants following the\nGovernment announcements regarding the use of surplus grains. The current\nethanol blending rate in India has reached a level of 5.1% amounting to 200\ncrore liters in the current year. With the Government’s plan to reach 10% by 2022\nand 20% by 2030 there is a significant capacity that needs to be built to cater\nto the additional blending requirement by 2022. With a view to achieving blending\ntargets Government is encouraging sugar mills and molasses-based standalone\ndistilleries to enhance their ethanol distillation capacity. Based on the\nethanol supply offers, Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have\nallocated 325.5 crore liters for Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) (period from Dec. to\nNov.) 2020-21 to be blended with petrol under the EBP Programme.\n\n\nSource:GIA Research & ISMA\nIn\nfact, to meet the target of 20% ethanol blending, the industry will fall short of\nsugarcane and will have to depend on grains too. Distillery margins have been\nstrong, so despite just 15% revenue contribution, the profit contribution is\nmore than 50%. Most sugar companies are already working on expanding ethanol\ncapacity. This will give them the flexibility to shift production between sugar and\nethanol to maximize profitability.\n\nThus the ethanol distillation capacity in the country\nwould increase from 426 crore liters per annum to about 590 crore liters per\nannum by 2022. To encourage sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to produce\nethanol for blending with petrol, the Government has allowed the production of\nethanol from B-heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and sugar and has\nalso fixed the remunerative ex-mill price of ethanol derived from these\nfeed-stocks. The state-wise targets for ethanol manufacture have also been\nfixed.\n\n\nEthanol Process\n\n\nSource: Novozymes\nIn order to enhance the ethanol production\ncapacity in the country, DFPD has informed that Government has notified a the modified scheme on January 14,2021 for extending financial assistance in the\nform of interest subvention on loans advanced by Banks/NCDC/IREDA/NBFCs and any\nother financial institutions to project proponents for different activities\nviz. setting up of new distilleries, expansion of existing capacity,\ninstallation of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) System and Molecular Sieve\nDehydration (MSDH) Column, etc. for production of first-generation (1G) ethanol\nfrom feedstock such as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum), sugarcane\nand sugar beet, etc. including granaries and surplus rice with Food Corporation\nof India (FCI).\n\n\nEnzyme Biotechnology: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/12/what-are-enzyme-biotechnology-market.html\nCompany Analysis: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/01/praj-industries-apis-fermentation.html\nPart 2 - https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/05/ethanol-industry-insights-part-2.html\nSource: ISMA\nNovozymes\nET Now\nGIA Research \n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Enzymes – Improving\nevery life, every day\n\n\nTwitter: shuchi_nahar\nThe Indian enzyme market is yet to find its feet, as it is quite small when compared to the other sectors in the country. However, the growing awareness about the capabilities of enzymes and the subsequent benefits (both nutrition and cost-wise) will be important growth factors in the coming years. Nature’s enzymes and microbes are at work everywhere – from converting sugar into energy inside your cells, to enabling photosynthesis in the trees and plants outside your window. \n\n\nWhat are Enzymes?\nEnzymes are proteins that act as catalysts. When one substance needs to be transformed into another, nature uses enzymes to speed up the process. In our stomachs, for example, enzymes break down food into tiny particles to be converted into energy.\n\n\nEnzymes are used as catalysts to manufacture a variety of everyday products - like sugar, beer, bread, and ethanol. They are also used directly in products such as laundry detergent, where they help remove stains and enable low-temperature washing.\n\n\nIndustrial Enzymes have been used in the food & beverages industry for decades now. They are mainly used in baking, brewing, and food preservation. Microbial enzymes are increasingly preferred over plant and animal enzymes, owing to their high level of stability. \n\n\nIn specialized enzymes, the polymerases & nucleases are the largest segments whereas in industrial enzymes, carbohydrate, which is a cost-effective and flexible segment, is widely used. Enzymes segment enjoys very high margins compared to other specialty ingredients, as it is a highly research-driven segment and also requires significant time investment before getting approvals for registrations or patents. \n\n\nEnzymes are another sunrise industry and are expected to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis as industries keep moving away from synthetic solutions. Along with a better margin profile, enzyme companies claim premium valuations.\n\n\nIndustrial enzymes and specialty enzymes are expected to grow at 6% and 7% CAGR respectively over 2019-25\n\n\nSource: Global Market Insights\n\n\nThe enzymes industry has very high entry\nbarriers on account of extensive R&D focus and long gestation period before getting registration approvals for\nproducts in the USA and EU. Most companies are now moving away from synthetic products to eco-friendly solutions and\nenzymes is a sunrise industry with significant growth potential across various industries. Therefore,\npure enzyme players claim premium valuations over other companies.\n\n\nEnzyme Market Size \nFashionista? Foodie? Enzymes have you covered. \nEnzymes\nmake many of the products you use even better. They're good for the environment\ntoo. Enzymes can replace chemicals and minimize energy consumption.\n\n\nSource: Global Market Insights\nEnzyme market size is projected to surpass\nUSD 10.7 billion by 2024, Inclusive Global enzymes market is set to gain remarkable\nsignificance over the coming years, with the increasing usage of enzymes as\nbiocatalysts in various industrial processes and reactions. Strong application\noutlook of enzymes in biofuels, detergents, food & beverages, and animal\nfeed to improve the overall quality of the product is fueling the enzymes the market size in these sectors.\n\n\nRising demand for high-quality meat,\nbeef, and other protein food has fueled the penetration of enzymes in the\noverall food & beverage sector. Escalating demand for nutritional packaged\nand processed foods with extended shelf-life has propelled the growth of the enzyme market.\n\nThe food enzymes market, at a CAGR of 6.9%, is projected to be valued at\n$3.23 billion by 2023. Factors like better food quality, rising demand for\nprocessed food, and increased awareness about nutrition-rich foods have\ncontributed towards the market’s growth. With the growing demand for\nenvironment-friendly manufacturing processes, the market is primed to shift\ntowards a path of a promising and sustainable future. \n\n\nThe industrial enzymes market is valued at $5.9 billion in 2020\nand with a CAGR of 6.5%, it will touch an estimated $8.7 billion by 2026 and will continue to propel the industry for\nyears to come. Industrial usage has been boosted by developments in enzyme\nengineering and green chemistry, coupled with the increasing use of genetically\nengineered enzymes.\n\n\nGrowth driver for bioethanol production\nThe ethanol process through the usage of Enzymes. Enzymes are applied in multiple stages, along with yeast in fermentation. \n\nSource: Novozymes\n1. Past: Basic products for liquefaction and saccharification \n2. Present: Multiple offerings across liquefaction, saccharification, and now also yeast \n3. Future: Increasingly customized solutions for liquefaction and saccharification, novel solutions for other process steps\n\n\nIndustrial\nenzymes and specialty enzymes are expected to grow at 6% and 7% CAGR respectively\nover 2019-25\n\n\nSource: Global Market Insights\n\n\nIn FY19, the Indian enzyme industry was valued at 23.60 billion with a growth rate of 7%. The developments in pharmaceuticals and\nchemical sectors will provide a much-needed boost to the enzyme market and it is\nexpected that the demand for specialty enzymes will be more than the industrial\nones.\n\n\nThe Indian manufacturers are\nexpanding their market base by exporting their products to a number of\ncountries. In FY20, on an average per quarter enzymes worth approx. 78.57\ncrores were exported to the USA, Japan, Germany, and Denmark. With the revival of\nthe economy, an increase in foreign direct investment will support the industry\nand promote the use of enzymes. The government will motivate R&D in\nbiotechnology to exhibit the nation’s capabilities in terms of pharmaceuticals\nand the relevant technology. \n\nThe flourishing food and beverage sector has significantly\nfueled the demand for carbohydrates, which are used to catalyze the starch\nconversion process. The Asia Pacific is observing high population growth and a\nconsiderable rise in its food & beverage industry base. Japan, South Korea,\nIndia and China are the leading countries that are driving the Asia Pacific\nenzymes industry trends. As per estimates, the regional market is anticipated\nto show a 9% rate of growth over the period of 2016-2024.\n\nThere is a large potential for future enzyme\ninclusion, especially in emerging markets. Significant up-dosing and\npenetration potential in emerging markets in general and in the Asia Pacific in\nparticular.\n\n\nSource: Novozymes\n\n\nThis move will make India an attractive market and companies\nwill look for inroads for gaining ground. Apart from biotechnology and\npharmaceuticals, enzymes are resourceful in other industries like household\ncare, food, and beverage, leather manufacturing, animal feed, etc. Better\nR&D infrastructure and increased awareness about enzymes and their products\nwill help in improving the overall market size in India.\n\n\nSources & Credits:\nNovozymes Annual Report\nGlobal Market Insights \nGrandview Research \nMarket Media\n\nLink to Enzyme Biotechnology:\nhttps://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/12/what-are-enzyme-biotechnology-market.html \n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

Its specialty chemicals product\nofferings are used in pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates, engineering\nfluids, electronic chemicals, polymer additives, water treatment, construction\nand aroma chemicals, flavors and fragrances, specialty polymers, Chemicals and\nVapor Absorption Chillers – original-equipment manufacturers. \n\n\nIn addition to manufacturing specialty\nchemicals, Neogen undertakes custom synthesis and contract manufacturing. This\nincludes developing a product and customizing it primarily for a specific\ncustomer, with the process know-how and technical specifications, developed in-\nhouse.\n\n\nSource: Neogen Chemical AnnualReport & Investor Presentation\n\n\n85% Revenue – Agro and Pharma\nCompany is\nfocused on working with new customers in the agro and pharma segment bearing fruit, as the company gains newer opportunities for molecules with\ntremendous business potential, stable revenue projections, and better margin\nprofiles. Almost 85% of Neogen’s revenue is derived from pharma and\nagrochemical industries. specialty organic chemical compounds find use in\napplication industries such as pharmaceutical, agrochemical, flavor and\nfragrance and electronic-chemical.\n\n\nSource: Neogen Chemical AnnualReport & Investor Presentation\n\n\nNeogen\nmarket and sell their products in India and export our products primarily to\nEurope, the USA, and Japan. Advanced intermediaries combine bromination with other\nchemistries to create forward integrated value-added products to be used as\nintermediates for manufacturing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), Agrochemical\nActive Ingredients (AI) and other Specialty Chemicals like Aroma Chemicals\nPolymer Additives etc.\n\n\n\nCapacity Expansion - Capturing future demands\nIn light of higher demand from exports for\nlithium-based products, Neogen undertook the expansion of its Inorganic Lithium\nsalt manufacturing capacity at the site in SEZ at Dahej with a land area of\napprox. 50,000 m. Executing Brownfield manufacturing capacity expansion, Neogen\nhas also invested in setting up of a large plant for manufacturing of Advanced\nIntermediates at Dahej. \nNeogen commissioned its greenfield manufacturing unit\nfor inorganic chemicals at Dahej SEZ in February 2020. Neogen also received new\ncustomer approval for Lithium salts and has already started exporting from the\nplant.\nCapacity in Phase - I is going to be Rs. 500 crore capacity of which, the original target\nwas to achieve Rs. 450 crore in FY22. Two Long-term contracts for innovative molecules, the company has signed with international customers.\n\n\nIndian Chemical Industry – Upcoming Growth Ahead\nIndia’s chemical industry is a global\noutperformer in returns to shareholders and remains an attractive hub for\nchemical companies. This outperformance has resulted in high expectations for\nsustained, continual growth of the industry’s top line and bottom line. The macro perspective on India indicates that while the short-term outlook is\nchallenging, the country’s long-term growth story remains positive.\nSpecialty\nchemicals are a niche segment of relatively high-value low-volume chemicals,\nwhich are targeted at various applications in specific end-user industries.\nAccording to a recent report by Allied Market Research, the global specialty\nchemicals market was valued at USD 711.0 billion in 2019 and is estimated to\nreach USD 953.9 billion by 2027 - with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of\n5.0%.\n\n\n\nIncreasing investible opportunities in India \nAccording to McKinsey report  India’s trade flow in the chemical sector to\nidentify and better understand investible themes in the domestic industry.\nChemicals are a significant part of India’s overall trade flow, consistently\nranking third in imports and fourth in exports for the past five years.\nToday, India has a chemical trade\ndeficit of USD 15 bn. Analysis of India’s chemical exports and imports, coupled\nwith a review of opportunities emerging from global trends, suggests two\ninvestible themes: \n\nBuilding self-sufficiency in\npetrochemicals to plug the domestic supply shortfall of 52% (by volume) in\npetrochemical intermediates: Six value chains make up around 77%  of this shortfall, creating an opportunity\nworth about USD 11 bn.\nRamping up exports in select areas,\nsuch as specialty chemicals, to obtain a larger share of global value. The\nchemical industry already contributes significantly to India’s trade volume.\nCapturing emerging opportunities in the near term could make a positive\ndifference to Indian chemical companies and to the industry overall. Chemicals\nrank fourth in imports, after mineral fuels and oils, precious stones and\nmetals, and electrical machinery, also with a 9% share.\n\nIndia’s trade flow breakdown in 2018\n\n\nSource: McKinsey Research Report\n\n\nIndian Specialty Chemical Industry\nAccording to the Federation of Indian\nChambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the specialty chemical industry in\nIndia had a market size of USD 35.9 billion in FY 2018-19. FICCI further\nprojected a CAGR of 12%-14% for the specialty chemical industry to reach a market\nsize of USD 59 billion by FY 2023-24. The specialty chemical industry\ncontributes about 22% of the total chemical industry.\n\n\nSource: Neogen Chemical AnnualReport & Investor Presentation\n\n\nThe industry has a domestic as well as an export\nmarket. India’s specialty chemical manufacturing sector with its availability\nof good academic talent, low operating overheads, better manufacturing and\ncompliance standards, stringent environmental policy, availability of feedstock, and skilled labor can be the next preferred exporter for global players. \nDespite the current pandemic situation, the Indian chemical industry has numerous opportunities considering the supply chain disruption in China and trade conflict among the US, Europe, and China. Anti-pollution measures in China will also create opportunities for the Indian chemical industry in specific segments.\n\n\nSources: Neogen Chemical Ltd.

    "summary": "Dharamsi Morarji Chemical Company - Company Overview\nThe Dharamsi Morarji\nChemical Company Limited (DMCC), established in 1919, was the first producer of\nSulphuric Acid and Phosphate fertilizers in India. Over the years, the brand of\nthe Company (“Ship”) came to be recognized as the quality standard for Single\nSuperphosphate (SSP). Until recently, DMCC was known primarily as a fertilizer\nproducer, with over 75% of revenue from SSP. As a strategy, DMCC structured\nitself to Speciality Chemicals. With focused Research and Development efforts,\nprocesses for downstream sulfur-based chemicals were commercialized.\n\n\n\n\nDiversified\nProduct & Customer Base\nThe company has 34 unique products across bulk and\nspecialty chemicals. The company has a wide product basket that helps us in penetrating\nnew geographies and acquiring new customers. The chemicals manufactured and\napplied in a wide range of industries across 25 countries.\n\n\nImpact on Bulk Chemicals\nCompanies  bulk chemicals had an unfavorable market\nconditions and earned lower realization as compared to the previous year.\nWhile they maintained their market share, the company did witness a decline in the\ntopline and bottom line. The company is in good progress with its plans to\ndebottleneck and expand operations in the Roha facility. The company is also adding\nincremental capacity for sulphuric acid in Dahej, which will enable them to tap\nnew customers as they continue to be cost-efficient in their bulk chemicals\nbusiness.\n\n\nGrowth of Speciality Chemicals\nCompanies specialty chemicals business is progressing\nwell. Despite facing stiff challenges from Chinese competitors, the company has\nmanaged to maintain strong demand for its products in export markets. Their\nstrategy going forward is to be a backward integrated specialty chemical\ncompany. With this, their focus will be on strengthening the innovative funnel\nto ensure aggressive growth. The company will be going under significant\ntransformation with an ambitious investment plan in this segment.\n\nGrowth in Sales over the years\n\n\n\nFinancial Performance for Q3FY21\nThe\nrevenues of the company in Q3FY21 increased by 16.95% to 47.33 cr. as compared\nto 40.47 cr. in Q3FY20. The company recorded a strong overall performance\ndespite a planned maintenance shutdown of 35 days during the quarter. The\ncompany also witnessed strong demand from the export market during the quarter.\nSegment Performance for Q3FY21\nThe company witnessed a strong performance in the specialty chemicals segment with the reopening of domestic industries. The demand from export markets continued to\nremain strong during the quarter despite the 2nd wave of COVID in European\ncountries. \nThe\ncommodity segment of the boron business continued to face a challenging environment with the availability of raw materials being a roadblock. However, the\ncompany continues to witness traction on the specialty part of the boron\nbusiness.\nThe\nvolumes in the bulk chemicals business were subdued owing to the maintenance\nshutdown. The company expects the volumes in bulk chemicals to recover from the\ncurrent quarter.\n\n\nCapex\nto cater to future demands\nBulk\nchemicals at Dahej\nThe company will be investing 50 cr.\nin adding incremental capacity in the bulk chemicals segment.\nThe company has been facing certain\nchallenges in terms of delays from vendors, however, the company is on track to\ncomplete the project by June 2021.\nSpecialty chemicals at Dahej \nThe company will invest 20 Cr. in a\ndedicated plant at Dahej facility. The company will use this facility for\ncontract manufacturing. The products to be manufactured and other details\nremain confidential as the company has signed an NDA. The plant is expected to\nbegin commercial production in the 2nd half of 2021.\nDebottlenecking at Roha \nThe company is progressing well on its\nplans of debottlenecking at the Roha facility. The company will invest ~ 10 cr.\non this project. The company is on track to complete this project by April\n2021.\nMultipurpose plants at Dahej \nThe company will further invest Rs. 10\ncr. in 2 multipurpose plants at the Dahej facility. The company plans to begin\ncommercial production in these multipurpose plants by the end of the current\nfinancial year.\nIntermediates Plant at Dahej \nThe company had plans to invest Rs. 20 cr. for\nexpansion to manufacture intermediates for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical\nindustry. This project is expected to complete by December 2021 The company had\nearlier decided to invest this amount in Sulfones. However, with a downturn in\nthe international markets for the product category, the plan has been put on\nhold. \nOpportunities in\nthe domestic chemical landscape\nThe chemical industry already contributes to India’s trade volume.\nCapturing emerging opportunities in the near term could make a positive\ndifference to the Indian chemical companies and to the industry in general. Diversification\nof supply chains out of China coupled with stricter environmental norms is\nchanging the structure of the Chinese chemical industry.\n\n\nThese factors are causing\nuncertainty among international players that source chemicals from China. This could create an opportunity for the\nIndian chemical players in certain value chains and segments.\nSteadily\nshepherding the industry towards higher environmental standards, China’s\nstricter norms are disrupting some parts of the chemical value chain.\n \nTrade conflicts have erupted around the world, especially among\nChina, the United States, and Western Europe. These have led to shifts in supply\nchains, affecting bilateral trade between China and United States, with\npossible repercussions for other economies. Large chemical markets that\nremain accessible could present opportunities for Indian\nchemical companies. Sustainability is becoming an imperative, with various\nstakeholders placing a premium on it. The government of China has set\nprovincial targets and is shutting down non-compliant companies. Chemical\ncompanies that prioritize environmental sustainability while complying with\nlocal regulations may stand to benefit from this opportunity.\n\n\nSpecialty chemicals are the leading Indian chemical export\nsegment, making up more than half (55%) of total chemical export value in 2018.\nYet they contribute only 3% of the total export value of specialty\nchemicals worldwide. Compared to 13% for China, 11% for Germany and 5% for\nJapan. There is enough room for growth for companies operating in this segment.\n\n\nFocus on Research and Development\nThe company focuses\non the research-led conversion of generic materials into value-added niche\nspecialty chemicals. The company has been incrementally increasing its spending on\nR&D to enhance their process chemistry skills, improve product quality and\nprocess yields of existing products. R&D spend in the financial year ending\nMarch 2020 stood at a life-time high of INR 2.25 cr. which is 40% higher as\ncompared to the previous financial year. \nWith a strong\nfocus on R&D and 2 manufacturing units, the company is well placed to benefit\nfrom the upcoming industry opportunities.\n\n\nCreating New Growth Platforms\nIn 2019 company\nbroke ground on their upcoming sulphuric acid and specialty chemical plant\nspread across 1,03,000 sq. mt. the plot in Dahej. This will further enhance their\nsulphuric acid capacity by 300 MT/day and expand their reach to new customers. \nThe\ncompany will also add capacities for Benzene Sulfonyl Chloride, Sulfones, and a\nrange of Thio Compounds. \nThe company expects this unit to start by June 2021. With a\nplanned expenditure of about 50 cr. on the sulphuric acid plant, the company\nexpects to derive 1.5 - 2x fixed asset turns on this asset. This will be a\none-time investment that will take care of their sulphuric acid needs for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n\n Disclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

We are pioneers in indigenous chemical technology and\nsustainable waste management. Innovation has always been a key driving force at\nExcel. Since its inception in 1941, Today, the company is all set to embark on a\nnew phase of meaningful growth. Excel is one of India's premier manufacturers\nof Specialty Polymer Additives and high-quality Veterinary APIs. The company is all set to apply its chemical\nprocess know-how in the Pharmaceutical Intermediates industry while\ncontinuing its leadership position in agrochemical intermediates and\nphosphorous derivatives.\n\nExcel Industries Ltd although listed in\nPesticides and Agrochemicals is a diversified company with Pharma API,\nVeterinary Medicine and most impotently a high potential futuristic\nEnvironment& Biotech Division.\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Structure\n– Chemical Business\n·       \nThe Size of the Indian specialty chemicals\nindustry is estimated at US $ 63 billion. Agrochemicals and Pharmaceuticals\n(API & Intermediates) account for US $ 5.7 billion and US $ 12.8 billion\nrespectively.\n\n·       \nThe Company is a leading manufacturer of\nspecialty and performance chemicals.\n\n·       \nSpecialty and performance chemicals are\nknowledge chemicals which require specialized skills and knowledge for\nmanufacture in terms of chemistry and engineering capabilities, material\nhandling and effluent treatment.\n\n·       \nSpecialty chemicals are required in a number of\nend-use applications ranging from the Life Sciences (Agrochemical and\nPharmaceuticals) to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). Production of specialty\nchemicals require good knowledge of the requirements of the end-user\napplications to whose needs they are meant to cater.\n\n·       \nAll specialty chemicals are subject to varying\ndegrees of regulatory requirements and the demand for these chemicals can be\nimpacted by changes in regulations.\n\n (Source – Report of Credit Suisse on the\nAgrochemicals segment & CII-KPMG report on Pharmaceuticals).\n\n\n\nIndustry Structure\n– Environment Biotech Business\n·       \nThe Municipal Solid Waste Management activity in\nIndia, which was hitherto fragmented and unorganized, is finally taking shape\nof an organized industry on the back of streamlined legislation, legitimate\nplayers. \n\n·       \nIn the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the need\nfor scientific collection, treatment and disposal of waste will be highlighted\nmore than ever before. \n\nThe company will look to seize these opportunities\nthrough its offerings in centralized and decentralized waste management,\nlegacy waste management and bio-remediation of landfill sites as also\ncollaboration with Indian and International partners to unlock opportunities in\nIndia.\n\nRevenue Trend over\npast 5 years\n\n\n\n\nSegment-wise\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\nThe total sales turnover of the Company for the year 2019 –\n20 was ` 702 crores as against ` 825 crores for the year 2018-19. The turnover\nof the Chemicals Division for the year 2019 – 20 was ` 685 crores and that of\nthe Environment and Biotech Division was ` 17 crores.\n\nChemicals - Opportunities\nin coming years\nThe company see good demand for the Organophosphorous (OP)\nintermediates manufactured by the Company. The reason is that the good rabi\nharvest has helped in depleting the channel inventories. The IMD has forecast a\nnormal monsoon in 2020 which augurs well for the demand of downstream\nagrochemicals in the Kharif season.\n\nThe Phosphonate range of products finds application in\nsegments like water treatment, soaps, and detergents, industrial and\ninstitutional cleaners (I & I), etc. The emphasis on sanitization and\ncleaning in the wake of Covid 19 has meant a good demand for these products.\nThe demand from the US market has been good and we expect this to continue for\nthe balance of the year.\n\nThe Company has been able to establish itself as a serious\nplayer in the pharmaceutical intermediates and API segment. The company is backward\nintegrated into these APIs and expects to consolidate its position and grow in\nthese products and it is also working on developing new APIs and intermediates.\n\nIn light of the supply disruptions from China in recent\nyears, there is a conscious strategic drive on the part of customers to\nmitigate the risk of sourcing from China.\n\nEnvironment &\nbiotech – Two major projects inline \nThe company bagged two key projects in the FY 2019-20. Operations\nand Maintenance contract of 600 TPD Municipal Solid Waste Plant at\nVaranasi for a period of two years starting January 2020.\n\nBio Mining of 900 TPD Legacy Waste at Ahmedabad starting January 2020\nThe ENBT business recorded a turnover of INR 17.78 Crores in the financial year\n2019-20. The major contribution to the turnover is mainly due to the two key\nprojects mentioned above. The FY 2020-21 will be a challenging year. The demand\nfor Organic Waste Converter systems will below. \n\nThe Company will focus on additional sources of revenue to\nmake existing projects profitable, namely through the sale of Segregated\nCombustible Fuel (SCF) and Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF).\n\nRecent\nAcquisitions to cater to rising demands in future\nDuring the year, excel successfully acquired the\nmanufacturing unit of Net Matrix Crop Care, which is located in Andhra Pradesh.\nThe facility produces Sodium Trichloropyridinol which has a high-value\npotential and can generate healthy revenues and profitability margins for The company, going ahead.\n\nThe acquisition of the Vizag site presents an exciting\nopportunity to explore forward-looking strategic plans for the Company. Vizag\nsite is a fully functional plant, coming with regulatory clearances and adequate\nopen space for constructing new plants for products of the future.\n\n\nIncrease in Gross block while simultaneously increase in\nCash flow from operations\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Praj Industries - APIs, Fermentation, Biologics, and allied sectors with new Technologies and Tie-ups. \nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar \nCompany Overview\n\n\nPraj\nIndustries (Praj), India’s most accomplished industrial biotechnology Company\nwith global footprints, is driven by innovation, integration, and delivery\ncapabilities. Over the past three decades, Praj has focused on the environment,\nenergy, and agri-process industry, with over 750 customer references spanning\n75 countries across 5 continents. Praj’s diverse portfolio comprises of\nBio-energy solutions, High purity water systems, Breweries, Critical process\nequipment & skids, and Zero liquid discharge systems. \n\n\nPraj has\npioneered the Bio-Mobility that envisages using renewable biological resources to\nproduce carbon-neutral transportation fuels across all modes of mobility i.e.\nSurface, Air, and Marine. The bio-Mobility platform comprises Biofuels both in\nliquid, as well as gaseous form and, are derived by processing feedstock such as\nAgri residue, Molasses, Cane syrup, grains, oilseeds, etc. \n\n\nBioenergy the portfolio comprises of technology solutions for first-generation ethanol,\nadvanced biofuel (second-generation ethanol), compressed biogas (CBG) and\nbiodiesel systems. Biofuels are produced using three types of bio-based\nfeedstock namely sugary (C molasses, B molasses, sugar syrup, etc.), starchy\n(damaged/ surplus grains, maze, etc.) and cellulosic (Agri residues and biomass).\n\n\nCurrently, the ethanol\nblending rate in the country is just 5%. The progressive National Biofuel\nPolicy launched in 2018 has a stated objective of reaching 10% ethanol blending\nby 2022 and 20% by 2030. The policy envisages the production of ethanol from an expanded\nrange of feedstock such as B heavy molasses, juice, syrup, and damaged grains.\n\n\nThe company partnered with Dedini S/A Indústrias de\nBase of Brazil to provide advanced technologies for ethanol production for\nSouth America, and with Sekab E-Technology AB, Sweden to commercialize\ntechnology to produce advanced biofuels and biochemicals from forest residue.\n\n\n\nOrder Book\nas of Q2 FY21: Rs 405 Cr.\n\n\nTechnologies and Tie-ups that bodes\nwell for the company\n\n\n1. Praj Industries and\nAutomotive Research Association of India (ARAI) entered into an MoU, to jointly address technologies to\npropagate the use of biofuels in a variety of applications including usage in ICE\nin the transportation sector.\n\n\n2. Gevo and\nPraj will provide technology, plant equipment, and EPC services to customers to\nproduce renewable Isobutanol that will be aggregated and transferred to various\nrefineries. Both parties will also provide technology, plant equipment, and EPC services\nto refineries for converting renewable Isobutanol into SAF through the\nASTM-approved pathway of Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ).\n\n\n3. Praj\nexpanded its business horizons and launched BioPrismTM technology\nportfolio for producing bio-based Renewable Chemicals and Materials\n(RCM). \n\n\n4. Praj has entered\ninto an MOU with National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) for developing\npromising innovative technology solutions in the RCM space. \n\n\n5. Praj has signed\nMoU with Lygos Inc, USA based biotech company, to co-develop Advanced\nLactic Acid Yeast Technology for Bio-based Products.\n\n\n\nRecent Key Developments\n1. During the year,Company was granted 6 Indian\npatents and 41 foreign patents. The Company filed 131 international patents last year. In all, the Company has 74 patents granted to its name.\n2. Praj bagged the Industrial Green\nChemistry World (IGCW) Award for the environment-friendly furfural technology.\n3. The enzymatic bio-diesel technology\nwas expanded to use low-grade feedstocks like tallow and waste fatty acids. Praj\nbagged the first order for 50 TPD biodiesel plant from tallow in UP.\n4. Praj developed lignosulphonate technology from\nthe lignin generated from the 2G infinity plant. This can be bolted on\nthe 2G plant to improve the overall viability of 2G ethanol plants.\n5. Praj completed the DBT Biodiversity\nscreening project in collaboration with D Y Patil University within timelines.\n20,000 microbes were screened for 4 target molecules in 2 years.\n\n\n\nCelluAPP® technology process\n\n\nEthanol availability &\nRequirement\n1. Total Annual installed capacity of\nEthanol and Alcohol in India is 693 Cr. Liters.\n2. Total Annual Installed Capacity of\nEthanol in India is 460 Cr. Liters( Grain Based – 75Cr. Liters, Molasses Based-\n385 Cr. Liters.\n3. In the next 5 years, the OMCs ethanol\nrequirement will be approx. 2000-2400 Cr. Liters as per 10% Ethanol Blending at\nall India basis.\n\n\n\nPraj HiPurity Systems (PHS)\nPraj\nHiPurity Systems (PHS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Praj Industries Limited.\nPHS offers water systems (WS), modular process systems (MPS) as well as the value\nadded services (VAS) to customers in biopharma, sterile formulations, topical\n& orals, cosmetics & personal care, and nutraceutical industry.\n\n\nPHS made importantly\nprogress in the complex injectables, a niche low volume high-cost product segment, which is gaining traction across the globe. The partnership with Aquanova,\nof Sweden especially to cater  all important injectables and vaccine industry\nis paying dividends. \nSeveral tops\nof the line, pharma majors have reposed faith in this value proposition by way\nof awarding contracts. \n\n\nThe drugs\ngoing off-patent in the coming 2-3 years have a very high proportion of Biologicals\nwhich include fermentation-based processes. PHS continues to focus on\nthis opportunity by offering solutions for greener fermentation-based\nmanufacturing processes. \n\n\nSignificant\norders are being secured in this important business segment offered under the\nMPS vertical.\n\n\nMore surprise elements to come – Praj\nHiPurity Systems\nWith the\nemerging shifts and focus on localization, the domestic pharma industry intends\nto bring a larger focus on producing API’s (Bulk drugs) to reduce dependency on\nChina. \n\n\nTo combat\nCovid-19, several projects are being set up for manufacturing COVID vaccines as\nwell as disinfectant liquid significant opportunities will emerge out of these\nnew investments.\n\n\n\nRevenue Trend Over the past 5 Years \n\n\nRevenue\nSplit for Recent Q2 FY21: Rs 260.24Cr.\n\n\n\nGlobal\nfermentation champion Novozymes with Indian biotechnology major has an active\ncollaboration with Praj in India for the past 10 years.\n\n\nStrong Pipeline to cater to future\ndemands\n\n\nBioenergy\nwhich is the core business of the company clearly see a significant effort from\nmultiple stakeholders now to make the whole system and the environment and the\nopportunity crystallize in terms of the definition of feedstock. \n\n\nThe demand\nfrom oil marketing companies have now been projected for 5 years through that\nand the prices have been rationalized. So, there is a clear move by the\ngovernment to tell the sugar mills that over the next 3 years period they will\nstart to reduce the quota for export and gradually bring it to zero over the\nnext 3 years and all of that surplus should get diverted to ethanol production.\nEven on the other hand if you look at the 2G technology it will be of great\nbenefit for the company.\n\n\nOn the CBG\nfront, the company has developed an ecosystem that will be very positive for\nsetting up the capacities. On the non-Bio-energy side of their business, as mentioned, the company sees clear traction coming out on the zero liquid discharge systems.\n\n\nThe PHS a business that is serving the very important pharma segment, already because of\nthe uptick in the pharma segment itself plus the success and the durability\nof the solutions that the company has built over a period of time, is now leading us to\na situation where customers are looking from a very different perspective on\nthe PHS's ability to provide solutions. So, all in all, it’s expected the whole\necosystem to be very positively oriented to build on the order book\nperformance. \n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Jubilant Life Sciences-Unseen Opportunities Ahead (COVID-19 Vaccine manufacturing, Demerger of business inline)\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nCompany Overview\nIncorporated in 1978, Jubilant Life\nSciences (JLS; formerly Jubilant Organosys), is a mid-sized integrated\nchemical turned pharmaceuticals player. It started as a full-fledged chemical a company by entering the vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) business in 1983. \nBroadly,\nthe company operates through two business segments - pharmaceuticals (62% of\nthe turnover) and life science ingredients (35% of turnover). \nThe\npharmaceuticals segment consists of sub-segments like \n1) generics \n2) specialty\npharma - radio pharma and allergy therapy products and \n3) CDMO - contract\nmanufacturing (CMO) of sterile injectables and API.\n\n\nIn November 2020, Jubilant Life\nentered into a strategic partnership with SOFIE Biosciences, Inc. (SOFIE), US.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Jubilant will acquire 25% of equity holding\nfor a cash consideration of US$25 million. \n\n\nThis partnership will enable them to\ncollaborate in the development, manufacturing, and distributions of\nradiopharmaceuticals that will help in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide\nvariety of oncology diseases. The acquisition is expected to be completed by January\n2021.\n\n\nLSI Segment \nWithin the LSI segment, Speciality Ingredients The business Unit is focused on developing new products. At any point in time,\nthere are 10-15 new products being worked upon. Specialty Intermediates faced\nheadwinds due to temporary impact on demand because of the pandemic, while\nNutritional growth was led by price growth and exports to the European market for\nVit-D3 products. \n\n\nLSC key product Ethyl Acetate growth was muted due to certain\ncustomer segments viz. Automotive (Paints), Consumer durables (Packaging) and\nElectronics sectors are witnessing lower activities during COVID-19.\n\nRevenue\nGrowth Trend\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company expects revenues and profitability in\nNorth America will continue to account for a significant portion of its\nfuture consolidated revenues as the company continue to focus on growth in this\nmarket. New products in the pipeline will lead to major revenue generation in\ncoming times. Two of their radiopharmaceutical products have received\n505(b)(2) approvals from the US FDA, namely Drax ExametazimeTM and RUBY-FILL®\nRubidium Rb82 Generator and Elution System.\n\n\nIn\naddition to Drax ExametazimeTM and RUBY-FILL® Rubidium Rb82 Generator and\nElution System, their Radiopharmaceuticals business line is in the process of\ndeveloping certain products such as I-131 meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (‘mIBG’) for\nwhich company plans to make a New Drug Application (‘NDA’) filing.\n\n\n\n\nPositive Impact of COVID-19 Vaccines\non Jubilant Life Sciences (therapeutic\nangles).\nCDMO on Ampligen Syringe Awarded FDA’s ODD\nstatus for pancreatic cancer-17 Dec2020. Syringe Advancing CTs of Ampligen as\npotential protective prophylaxis & an early-onset treatment for COVID19.\nSyringe Japan is evaluating as potential COVID-19 vaccine adjuvant.\n \nJubilantlife vaccine manufacturing (CDMO)\nduring 1995-2020 and beyond (Virus Outbreaks).\nIn 2009 - manufactured over 100 million doses,\nto treat the H1N1 virus Syringe. \nIn 2020 - manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines in\nthe US (Spokane facility) Syringe.\n \nJubilantlife\nplanning $70 million expansion in the US facility & expecting to add 400\njobs while doubling its existing space & fill-finish manufacturing capacity\nSyringe. Jubilant currently has 850 employees in Spokane.\n\nIncrease in trend for Employee Cost(in Cr.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR&D – Major growth driver for the company\nResearch & Development (R&D) is a key driver\nfor innovation and plays a vital role in developing and adopting new technologies\nin the technologically intensive life sciences industry. The company has designed a\nsuccessful R&D, which continues to ensure delivery of a sustainable pipeline of high-value products of Fine Ingredients and Intermediates.\n\n\nIn\naddition, we have seven other products in different stages of development for\nwhich we may consider making 505(b) (2) filings. For Allergy Therapy Products,\nsubject to the completion of relevant approvals from the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), we have filed our venom products and\nallergenic extracts for use in animals. We also have a strong pipeline in our\nAPIs and Solid Dosage Formulations businesses.\n\nPatents\nfiled and approved to date\n\n\n\n\n\nCMO\n& Generics – Will led to stronger growth\nCMO – New\nlyophilization installation in Q1, strong demand from customers as well as new\ndeals.\nSigned five\n(one in Q2) separate clinical and commercial supply agreements for Covid-19\ntreatment and vaccine candidates (sterile injectable).Robust order book and new\nbusiness sign-ups.Nanjangud (API) operations started, strong order book.\nExpecting 500 crores in revenue over 10-12 months from Covid products. \n\n\nRemdesivir\nstarted my contribution. Covid related products - 1 million vials produced.\nGenerics -\nled by strong performance in key products in the US market and by the launch of Remdesivir\nin various countries. Roorkee site capacity expansion completed in FY20.\nSalisbury site expansion is underway translating to 85% increase in capacity by\nFebruary 2021. Remdesivir production capacity increased from 2 lakh vials to\n4.8 lakh vials per month.\n\n\nPharmaceuticals business segment growth likely to be healthy \nRecent long term contracts in the\nradio pharma business, Rubyfill traction in the US coupled with Europe launch are\nexpected to strengthen specialty sub-segment growth that is likely to grow at\n8.6% CAGR in FY20-23E to 3869 crore. \n\n\nThis is on the back of strong decent\ngrowth in the radiopharmacy business (amid competition) and consolidation of the pharmacy business. The CDMO business was impacted in Q1 due to about two-month the shutdown of its Nanjangud API plant due to Covid (back on track in Q2).\n\n\nHowever, going ahead, it's expected\nthis segment to see strong traction on the back of improving operating\nleverage. Generic business is also posting decent growth on the back of base\nbusiness besides one-off opportunities. A key monitorable in the segment would be developments on the\nfive contract manufacturing agreements that the company has signed for Covid\ntreatment and vaccine candidates. On the LSI front, the performance continues to be\nlumpy except for the nutritional sub-segment.\n\n\nDemerger may complete in FY21\nNCLT approval received for demerger: JLS has\nrecently received the NCLT approval to go ahead with its demerger plan of\nhaving two separate entities for pharma and LSI (Life Science Ingredients)\nbusinesses. The board had initially approved this re-organization of the\nbusinesses in Oct'19 and the approval from shareholders and creditors were\nreceived in Aug'20. Key objectives of this re-organization were: \n1) Have\nseparate focus business entities, \n2) better management of risks and regulatory\nrequirements, \n3) enabling strategic growth with optimal capital allocation, and \n4) unlocking of shareholder value.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Scope for Medical Devices and Impact of Covid-19 \nPolymedicure Company Overview\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar \nBrief details about Medical Devices\nIndustry\n\n\nThe global medical devices market reached a value of nearly $456.9 billion in 2019, having\nincreased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% since 2015. The\nmarket is expected to decline from $456.9 billion in 2019 to $442.5 billion in\n2020 at a rate of -3.2%. The decline is mainly due to lockdowns imposed by the\ngovernments across the world that hindered the supply chain in the medical\ndevices manufacturing industry. \n\n\nHowever, there is an unprecedented increase in\nthe manufacturing of the ventilators and it's expected to rise in demand for\nsyringes as covid vaccines are claimed to treat COVID-19 patients. The market\nis then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 6.1% from 2021 and reach\n$603.5 billion in 2023.\n\n\nDrivers for Growth of Medical Technology Sector\nin India\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nIndian medical device industry continues its upward march of growth and is\nstrongly supported by India’s robust legal framework. There are certain\nchallenges to do the business of medical devices in India, but they can be easily\novercome with government support. The MedTech industry is redesigning its business model in line with the changing landscape -India-specific projects and\nMobile solutions to reach tier 2 and 3 cities. Government and industry\ncollaboration in different areas like Health Technology Assessment, Innovative\ndigital healthcare business models will help the government’s aim of universal\nhealth coverage and further boost the MedTech industry in the country.\n\n\n\nAbout the Company\n\n\nPolymed  was conceived\nand established in 1995 by a group of engineers and technocrats dedicated with\na vision of providing the highest quality of healthcare to mankind. The Company\nis one of the leading manufacturers and exporter of medical devices with\ndominant position in the disposable medical devices market. \nThe Company produces\nvariety of products in the segment of Oncology, Infusion Therapy, Dialysis,\nRespiratory Care, Urology, Gastroenterology, Blood Management System, Blood\nCollection System, Surgery and Wound Drainage, Anesthesia, etc.\n\n\nRevenue Growth Trend over the Years\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue growth registering a 12% compounded\nannual rate over the five periods through fiscal 2020 is expected to continue\nat a moderate pace. The major product, IV cannula, contributed around 29% of\ntotal sales in fiscal 2020 (28% in fiscal 2019), across more than 100 countries.\nThe company also has over 200 registered patents across countries. Continuous\ncapacity addition and product innovation and development will support revenue\ngrowth over the medium term.\n\n\nImpact\non Demand of Syringe –Beneficial for\nthe Company in Long-run\n\n\n\n\nThe\nestimated demand in India would be around 900 million pieces of different kinds of\nsyringes for just one shot of the vaccine, considering 60-70% of\nthe country gets vaccinated.\"The number would amplify to 1.8 billion if the\nvaccine India chooses to needs two shots. Looking to such a spike in demand for\nsyringes.\n\n\n\n\nManagement\nsaid that their company's insulin syringe is frequently used during vaccinations and\nthe company has offered this product to the Government for the Covid-19 vaccination\ndrive. He added that many other companies are making similar products\nand that the government should start the procurement process for syringes as\nearly as possible. He said that the Covid-19 vaccine will soon arrive in the\nmarket.\n\n\n\nManagement\nsaid that the government may soon give permission to 3 or 4 companies to start\nmanufacturing Covid-19 vaccines in India. He averred that Poly-Med will need a syringe, needle cutter, and cold chain products which will be required to\ntransport the vaccine. Management revealed that the company has\ndecided to raise Rs 400Cr out of which Rs 150 to Rs 200 cr will be used\nby the company to take the benefit of the PLI Scheme. Management said in the next 5 to 7\nyears medical device industry will completely become Atmanirbhar and there will\nno need to import any devices.\n\n\nRevenue from Medical Devices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Facilities\n\n\nThe company has a strong track record of manufacturing high quality medical\ndevices in 8 state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities across the world. They\nhave 5 manufacturing facilities in India (3 facilities in Faridabad and 1 each\nin Jaipur and Haridwar).\n\n\nPolymed manufactures more\nthan 125 products using state of the art technology in ultra-modern\nfacilities & state of art technology covering over 400,000 square feet of\nmanufacturing floor space with about 100,000 square feet of cleanrooms of class\n100,000 to class 1,000 (ISO Class 7 & 8). An R&D center with modern\nfacilities support the development process.\n\nForeign Facilities \n\n\nIn China, the company operate their manufacturing facility in LaiyangQingdao,\nChina, through Poly Medicure (Laiyang) Co. Ltd, wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThis facility commenced commercial operations in fiscal 2010 and is spread over\nan area of 10,913 square meters. The total manufacturing area includes a cleanroom area of 1,006.40 square meters.\nIn Egypt, the company hold a 23% equity interest in Ultra for Medical Products,\nEgypt operates a manufacturing facility in Assuit, Egypt for disposable\nmedical devices. It is spread over an area of 12,500 square meters. In Italy, Company has wholly-owned step-down subsidiary Plan1 Health\ns.r.l., an Italy based manufacturing Company.\n\n The Private and Foreign\nInvestments\n\n\nInternational companies in this field are also using India as a\nmanufacturing base by either setting up facilities of their own or by acquiring\ndomestic manufacturers. Medical Technology Parks have been proposed by the\nGovernment of India in addition to the existing parks to encourage domestic\nmanufacturing of medical equipment. FDI inflow will spur R&D and\nmanufacturing innovations, in turn increases the efficiency and effectiveness\nof medical electronic products.\n\n\n\nFocus on R&D and\ninnovation\n\n\nR&D is primarily focused on developing new products within existing\nas well as new critical care product verticals and further improving existing\nprocesses and productivity.\nPolymed has developed the technology to create\nmoulds internally with a strong R&D team comprising of 50+ engineers and 30+\nengineers in process engineering. \n\n\nThe company operates a research and\ndevelopment center at Faridabad, Haryana, which is approved by the Department for\nScientific & Industrial Research and by the Ministry of Science &\nTechnology, Government of India. \nDue to the COVID-19 – Coronavirus pandemic,\ncompanies like Poly Medicure Ltd can have increased in demand ahead due to\nincreased health issue cases.\n\n\n\nStrong operating efficiencies\n\n\nStrong operating efficiencies are driven by labor-cost advantage over\nglobal competitors and in-house tool design and research and development\n(R&D) facilities. Operating margin is expected at 20-23% over the medium term, supported by comfortable capacity utilization and modernization of\nexisting facilities.\n\n\nThe company is poised for greater\ngrowth in coming years\n\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the PolyMed group is expected to continue to grow\nbecause of its strong presence in the export market,it contributes to 2/3 of total\nrevenue every year - to be supported by the introduction of products related to\nCovid-19 such as sterilized VTM Testing Kits, \nPersonal Protection Kits and Face Protective Shield.\n\n\nThe company's strong market position in its current product categories\nis supported by the expectation of continued healthy growth of the new\nproducts, which should contribute less than 5% for the entire year.\n\n\nHigher Medical Devices consumption expected in India due to the implementation of Aayushman Bharat. This Universal Healthcare Insurance Scheme in\nIndia will be a big game-changer for the Medical Devices industry. Preferential\nPurchases of domestically manufactured goods in India by the government. New Regulatory changes – Medical Devices Rules implemented from January\n2018. Now all Medical Devices will get regulated under new rules which will\nbring in the standardization of products and improve patient safety & quality.\n\n\nNational Medical Device Promotion Council –\nUnder the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Department of Industry Policy &\nPromotion (DIPP) - The setting-up of the Council will boost domestic\nmanufacturing as it will act as a facilitating promotional & developmental\nbody for the Indian Medical Devices Industry. Higher Private Insurance\npenetration driving the consumption of medical devices. Higher growth expected\nin the Renal Care & Diagnostic industry.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Advance\nEnzyme Technologies Ltd – Pioneers in Enzyme Biotechnology\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nLink: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/12/what-are-enzyme-biotechnology-market.html\nIncorporated by second-generation enzymologists, the Rathi\nbrothers in 1989, Advanced Enzyme Technologies (AET) is one of the largest\nresearch-driven Indian enzyme companies with a product basket of 400+\nproprietary products developed from 68 indigenous enzymes and probiotics. \nBroadly, the business can be divided into three segments – \n1) Human healthcare\n2) Animal healthcare \n3) Industrial processing. \n\n\nIt manufactures enzymes by using natural resources such as plants,\nfungal, bacterial, and animal sources, using environment-friendly biotechnology\nprocesses. It offers these products to 700+ customers across 45 countries\nworldwide.\n\n\nProduct Insights \n\n\nThis classification provides break-up\non the basis of the enzyme function. For example: \n1) Proteases: They break down proteins (used in industries like\ndetergent, leather, animal feed, food & beverage, pharmaceuticals, etc) \n2) Cellulases: They break down cellulose (used in industries such\nas paper & pulp manufacturing, coffee production, grain processing,\ntextile, animal feed, etc) \n3) Lipases: They break down fats (lipids) into glycerol and fatty\nacid (used in biofuels production, biocatalysis, industries such as leather,\ndairy and cheese, etc) \n4) Carbohydrases: They break down starch into simple sugars (used\nin industries like food & beverage, animal feed, cleaning agent, bio-fuel,\netc) \n5) Polymerases & nucleases: They replicate/break down DNA\nmaterial (used in research & biotechnology, diagnostic segments)\n\n\nRevenue\nGrowth Trend over the Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Enzymes estimated product type Bifurcation\n\n\n\n\nOligopolistic environment, vast addressable\nmarket to the fore \n\n\nGlobally,\ngrowth of the enzymes market piggybacks on a diverse spectrum of the customer base.\nThis, together with a limited number of meaningful players, has created a conducive business environment for existing players in the space. Note that\nenzymes as the cost to the percentage of sales is not material, yet its efficacy is\nvery important to end product including constituency of the end product in\nterms of its taste, appearance, aroma and, thus, quality perception of the\nproducts leading to significant supplier stickiness.\n\n\nRevenue Split Product Category Wise FY19 v/s\nFY20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialized the business model with high entry barriers One of the biggest challenges facing\nnew companies looking to enter the enzyme industry is to offer continuous and\ndifferentiated solutions as per the client’s requirement that demands real-time\nR&D capability and flexibility in manufacturing.\n\n\nLarge manufacturing capacities, proven\ncapabilities, experienced promoters, customer stickiness, fairly consistent\ntrack record, ability to develop new products in-house, and the quest for unique\nacquisitions are some differentiators for AET. Revenues have grown at a CAGR of\n11% during FY16-20 through the organic and inorganic route.\n\n\n\nBusiness segments \n\n\n\nHuman healthcare\n(pharma, nutraceuticals, and probiotics) The company provides proprietary enzyme\nproducts, probiotics, and customized enzyme solutions to various pharmaceutical\nand nutraceutical companies in the US, India, Europe, and other countries. While\npharma comprises 40% of the human healthcare portfolio, nutraceuticals account\nfor the remaining 60%. In pharma, the company provides proprietary enzyme products\nand customized enzyme solutions to various pharmaceutical and nutraceutical\ncompanies in India, the US, Europe, and the rest of Asia.\n\n\nCustomers use these enzymes as active ingredients in their pharmaceutical and nutraceutical formulations. Some of its key customers include Sanofi India, Alkem Labs, Emcure Pharma, and Torrent Pharma.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Healthcare \nAnimal healthcare\nsegment AET’s animal healthcare (animal HC) segment contributed 13% i.e 54 crores towards net revenues in FY20. Animals are\nfed with mainly two categories of livestock feed viz. 1) forage and 2) Fodder.\nOther than these two the third category is compound feed, which uses enzymes\nfor production. This feed is designed specifically to suit the nutritional\nrequirements of animals and includes additives, corns, soybeans, sorghum, oats,\nbarley, etc.\nHuman Healthcare\nHuman healthcare\nsegment AET’s human healthcare (Human HC) segment contributed 75% i.e 321 Crore towards net revenues in FY20.Human\nHealthcare and Nutrition AETL provides proprietary enzyme products and\ncustomized enzyme solutions to various pharmaceutical and nutraceutical\ncompanies in India, North America, Asia (ex-India), Europe, and other countries\nglobally. These products include various anti-inflammatory solutions,\ndigestion solutions, probiotics, etc. which are used by customers as active\ningredients.\nIndustrial Processing\nThe industrial enzymes\nsegment contributed 13% i.e 56 crores towards net revenues in FY20. As mentioned earlier,\nthe segment has been divided into two sub-segments- food and non-food\nindustrial processing. The food business consists of baking, dairy & cheese\nprocessing, fruits & vegetable processing, cereal extraction, brewing,\ngrain processing, protein processing, and oils & fats processing.\n\n\n\nR&D The biggest advantage for the company\n\n\nOne of The biggest challenges being faced by new companies looking to enter the enzyme industry is to offer continuous and differentiated solutions as per the\nclient’s requirement that demand real-time R&D capability and flexibility in\nmanufacturing.\n\n\n\nIntegrated R&D Facilities\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated player\nwith presence across enzyme chain, geographies AET is an integrated company\nwith a presence across the enzyme value chain, covering the entire range of\nactivities from R&D, commercial-scale manufacturing, to the marketing of enzyme\nproducts and customized enzyme solutions. \n\n\nIn the last five years, the company has enhanced fermentation capacity from 360\ncubic meter to ~510 cubic meters. AET intends to set trends in the R&D areas\nmainly for the formulation for new applications and will continue to\nsignificantly invest to build its portfolio in focus applications and\nindustries.\n\n\n\n*1\nGRAS Dossier under evaluation with US FDA\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "What are Probiotics and it's Predominant Role\nin COVID-19\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\n1.     Meaning of Probiotics\nProbiotic\nbacteria have become increasingly popular during the last two decades as a\nresult of the continuously expanding scientific evidence pointing to their\nbeneficial effects on human health. As a result they have been applied as\nvarious products with the food industry having been very active in studying and\npromoting them. \n\n\nWithin this\nmarket the probiotics have been incorporated in various products, mainly\nfermented dairy foods. In light of this ongoing trend and despite the strong\nscientific evidence associating these microorganisms to various health\nbenefits, further research is needed in order to establish them and evaluate\ntheir safety as well as their nutritional aspects.\n\n\n2.     Importance of Probiotics w.r.t COVID-19\nThe typical clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2\ninfection include dry cough (67%), fever (88%), fatigue (38%), myalgia (14.9%),\nand dyspnea (18.7%). Other symptoms include headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea,\nand gastrointestinal symptoms. Pneumonia appears to be the most common and\nsevere manifestation of the infection. Currently, there is no vaccine or\nspecific drug for COVID-19.  In addition to the SARS-CoV2, avian\ninfluenza, ebola, dengue, and Zika viral infections remain poorly controlled\naround the world.\n\n\nThe live microbes, which possess health benefits\non the host when administered in appropriately adequate amount, are referred to\nas probiotics and it includes a number of genera of bacteria and yeasts.\nProbiotics include Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus,\nand Enterococcus.  Probiotics play a role in\nbalancing the host defensive immune response, thereby stimulating mucosal\nbarrier function and modulating the immune system. \n\n\n3.    \nProbiotic as Immune Enhancers\nProbiotics exert several health beneficial effects\nto the host by several potential systems through the local immunity (by keeping\nup gut wellbeing and gut wall integrity) and systemic immunity (by enhancing\nspecific and non-specific immune system). The application of probiotics is\nefficient and competent for several ailments, including viral infections.\n\n\n\nSource: Appl Microbiol Biotechno\n\nThe mechanism involved upon host infected by\nCOVID-19. Pro inflammatory cytokines and interferons are released, and viral\ncellular translation is suppressed to induce viral clearance as a part of the\nhost immune response and an antiviral state in adjacent epithelial cells. Viral\nclearance occurs in lung and gut epithelium depending on the immune status of\nthe host. However, probiotic consumption improves.\n\n\n\n4.     Gut\nMicrobiota\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nmicrobial communities (bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses, and protozoa) in the\nhuman Gastrointestinal tract, lungs, skin, and mouth exist in a commensal relationship with\nhost cells, thereby playing a major role in human health. The commensal\nbacteria that are present in the GI tract are equivalent to the number of human\ncells. This colonization starts shortly after birth and their profiles and\nnumbers stabilize by the age of 1 year with more than 1000 bacterial species. \n\n\nThe\nGI microbiota has the ability to interact with human cells, including specific\nimmune cells. These interactions produce different health benefits in the host\nincluding regulating GI motility activating and destroying toxins.  Probiotics are also usually recommended for\npatients who have recently used antibiotics for treating any disease. Other\ncauses of dysbiosis in the human GI tract include exposure to toxins, stress,\ndisease, insufficient diet, and age. \n\n\n5.     Lung Microbiota and Respiratory Infection\nAs compared with the\nlower gastrointestinal part, the lungs contain about 10 to 100 bacteria per\n1000 human cells that is relatively less bacterial biomass. Probiotics mainly\ncolonize in the gut, but it has a fundamental impact on the systemic immune\nresponses. It can also colonize and exert the immune responses at distant\nmucosal sites, including the lung.\n\n\n\n6.     Gut-lung\naxis and COVID-19 \nThe\ngastrointestinal tract and lung are among the body compartments that host\nmicrobiota  however, the lung has a small\nnumber of microbiota when compared to that of the gut. In addition to the most\nfrequently described respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough and severe\nrespiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 infection, it has also been reported\nthat patients exhibited GI symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, loss\nof appetite, GI bleeding, and abdominal pain. \n\n\nPrebiotics\nmay also have an excellent potential effect against COVID-19 by enhancing\nprobiotics growth and survivability. Furthermore, prebiotics could have a\ndirect effect on GI symptoms caused by COVID-19 via blocking the ACE enzymes.\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2\nis a newly emerging virus that currently lacks curative treatments and\nvaccines. To date, no study has reported the use of prebiotics and probiotics\nto treat or prevent COVID-19, but the use of probiotics in the clinical\ntreatment or prevention of COVID-19 could be a suitable strategy. So far,\nseveral registered trials that aim to investigate the efficiency of probiotics\nin treating COVID-19 patients are ongoing. \n\n\n7.    \nFuture Augurs Well for Probiotics\nWith a growing\nbank of scientific research behind it, the probiotics category is\nunderstandably booming. According to recent figures, the market is expected to\nreach $7.1 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 7.8%.\n\n\nThe global\nprobiotics market size was estimated at USD 48.38 billion in 2018 and is\nanticipated to expand at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. It is\ndriven by the growing consumer inclination towards preventive healthcare in\nconjunction with the development of efficient probiotic strains.\n\n\n8.    \nReason\nfor growth in Probiotics due to COVID\nProbiotics are\nthe potential candidates which need to be tested more often in moderate and\nsevere cases of COVID-19 due to several beneficial effects, including easy\navailability, easy to administer, safety, and cost effectiveness. \n\n\nProbiotics –\ntargeting the pathophysiological processes in the context of COVID-19\ninfections, are one of the strategies that exert beneficial effects by\nmanipulation of the gut microbiota, activation of mucosal immunity, and\nmodulation of the innate and adaptive immune response.\n\n\n9.     Antiviral effects of Probiotics\nProbiotics may\nact as antiviral agents by interfering with the entry of the virus into host\ncells and/or inhibiting viral replication. This may lead to a reduction in the\nspread of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract and gut. In addition, with the\nrestoration of the gut and respiratory microbial harmony, immune function, and\ngut-lung axis, the course of COVID-19 may be altered. \n\n\nMost of the\nprobiotic strains are generally safe even in the vulnerable patient groups and\nin-hospital care settings, including neonates, children, and adults. Many\nprobiotic strains have indicated even beneficial effects in these settings. \n\n\n10.     Replacement of pharmaceutical agents\nprovides a major opportunity for probiotics\nThe increasing\ndemand for probiotics has shown that customers are preferring products with\nproven benefits. The increased evidence of health benefits associated with\nprobiotics for health restoration has increased the customer expectations\nrelated to probiotics for health curing functions. This inclination toward a\nsafe, natural, and cost-effective substitute for drugs has led the application\nof probiotics as pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\nBeneficial\neffects of probiotics as pharmaceutical agents seem to be strain-and\ndose-dependent. Clinical trials have displayed that probiotics may cure certain\ndisorders or diseases in humans, especially those related to the\ngastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n11.     Health Benefits Associated with\nProbiotics Fortified Food is A Major Driver for The Market\nHealth awareness\namong consumers is on the rise and most consumers are constantly in search of\nhealthy food products for consumption. Probiotics have proven strong benefits\nrelated to health, more specifically to the human digestive system. \n\n\nProbiotics are found in supplement\nform or as components of foods & beverages. Their integration with\ninexpensive health foods, such as yogurt, fruit juices, and cultured dairy\ndrinks has contributed to a significant market size. \n\n\nThe most commonly\nused bacteria include Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli,\nwhich are found in various dairy products, including yogurt. In the dairy\ncategory, yogurt is the most popular option for consumption of probiotics.\n\n\n12.     High R&D costs for developing new\nprobiotic strains is a major restraint for the probiotics market\nProbiotics\napplications are linked with health benefits, which make it challenging for\nmanufacturers to get an adequate return on investments on high initial\ninvestments. Research is needed to\ndetermine the accurate mechanisms of action of probiotics against coronaviruses\nincluding SARS-CoV-2 in healthy or infected animal models. These studies may\nlead to a better understanding of the bacterial dynamics in the GI tract. \n\n\nAnimal\nor human studies could be used to assess the direct effects of intranasal\nprobiotics through targeting pathogens in the lungs and indirect effect\noccurring through the modulation of immune activity. These studies may be\nhelpful for treating viral infections such as COVID-19.\n\n13.    \nProbiotics Market Segment\n\n\n\n\n14.     Top Impacting Factors\nfor Growth in Probiotics\n\n1)     Growing Health Concerns due to Novel Coronavirus\n2)     Rising Consumption of functional food\n3)     High awareness among consumers after Covid-19\n4)     Stringent Government Regulations\n5)     Increasing R&D Cost\n\n\n\nSources: \nsfamjournals.onlinelibrary\nSundararaman 2020 Article - Appl Microbiol Biotechno\n Grandview Research\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Ultimate Guide to CRAMS or CDMO  with various Companies to track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are CRAMS?\n\n\nCRAMS is defined as the process of\noutsourcing research services/ product manufacturing activities to\norganizations which can provide the service at a low cost. CRAMS basically\nconsists of the following two activities: Contract Research and Contract Manufacturing. CRAMS is mainly used in the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology\nsectors that require extensive R&D and large-scale manufacturing\nfacilities. It is expected that the demand for contract research and contract\nmanufacturing is expected to increase in India in the future.\n\n\nRoadmap Ahead\n\n\nInvestments in the global pharmaceuticals\nsector to increase to over $1,400 billion over the next 3 years, driven by\na number of new medicines. With healthy R&D spending going forward, the\nContract Research and Manufacturing (CRAMS) segment offers growth opportunities\nto Indian companies. \n\n\nRising demand for generic formulations,\nincreased investments in pharmaceutical Research & Development and advanced\nmanufacturing technologies by contract development and manufacturing\norganization (CDMO’s) are key factors contributing to the high CAGR of\nPharmaceutical Contract Manufacturing market during the forecast period.\n\n\nMarket Size – USD 82430.9 Million in 2018,\nMarket Growth – CAGR of 7.2 %, Market Trends – Increasing outsourcing of\nclinical trials, increasing CDMO’s manufacturing footprint in Asia. The\npharmaceutical industry uses outsourcing services from providers in the form of\ncontract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations\n(CMOs). Comprehensive single-source provider from drug development through\ncommercial manufacture has emerged in recent years.\n\n\nIt is known as contract research and\nmanufacturing services (CRAMS), or contract development and manufacturing\norganizations (CDMO). Pharmaceutical Contract Manufacturing organizations are a\nresponse to the competitive international nature of the pharmaceutical market\nas well as the increasing demand for outsourced services.\n\n\n\nLet’s Discuss in Nutshell\nFew Companies that I have covered in detail previously in my blogs.\n\n\n1) Laurus Labs\n–The Complete Turnaround Story\n\n\n\n\nLaurus Labs is a leading R&D\ndriven pharmaceuticals company established in 2005 with its headquarters in\nHyderabad. It is among the leaders in the manufacturing of Active\nPharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for Antiretroviral (ARV) and Hepatitis C\n(Hep-C) formulations. Other major API segments include therapeutic areas such\nas Oncology, Cardiovascular, and Anti-Diabetes.\n\n\nFrom a one-product company in 2010\nto an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) company thereafter, company has\nnow emerged as one of India’s leading manufacturers of generics APIs for\nvarious complex therapies.\nRevenue\nComparison FY19 v/s FY20\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant\nGrowth in CDMO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Detailed Analysis of the above company -https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/09/laurus-labs-company-overview.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2)    Hikal – An Unique CDMO for\nPharmaceutical, Crop Protection & Animal\n\n\nEstablished\nin 1988, Hikal is predominantly a B2B player that provides intermediates and\nactive ingredients to global pharmaceutical, animal health, crop protection and\nspecialty chemical companies. \n\n\nFor FY20, pharma and crop protection\naccounted for 59% and 41%, respectively, of operating revenues. \nThe pharma\nbusiness is currently divided almost equally between generic active pharma\ningredients (APIs) and contract development and manufacturing organisation\n(CDMO) businesses. \n\n\nAnimal\nhealth business accounts for 20-25% of CDMO business. In crop protection, 70%\nof revenues are derived from CDMO with the remaining from proprietary products,\nspecialty chemicals and specialty biocides. Leading Sustainable Technology\ndriven company serving the Crop Protection & Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\n\nCompany’s Crop Protection CDMO segment has 2-3\nproducts in the pipeline currently. These are all early stage products.\nOverall, product pipeline is healthy.\n\nRevenue\nGrowth Trend over the Years\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Detailed Analysis of the above company : https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/09/hikal-unique-cdmo-opportunities-for.html\n\n\n\n\nTo continue reading this great compilation of CDMO Companies Click the Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JCvMp0w4syVePB5jnmJsPGvsbSpyReZm/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Natco Pharma - Pioneer of Indian Oncology Market - Company Overview\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n1. Company\nProfile\n\n\nNatco Pharma\n(NPL) is a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company having presence in\nmultiple speciality therapeutic segments. Over the years, the Company has\ndeveloped an innate ability to deliver molecules, which are complex and hard to\nmanufacture. The Company has constantly innovated and manufactured speciality\nmedicines and niche pharmaceutical products. \n\nThe company\nalso has a US retail business. It owns 8 manufacturing facilities including 6 formulations\nfacilities and 2 API facilities. Overall revenues grew at a CAGR of 15.4% in\nFY16-20. Natco is a leading domestic player in the oncology space. NPL’s\nproduct pipeline consists of drugs, which are used for various types of cancer\nlike blood cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and\nprostate cancer. Currently, Natco is marketing 33 oncology products in the\nIndian market (FY20). \n\n\n\n2. Management\nGuidance\n\n\nThe\nmanagement has charted a new growth roadmap with recent entrance in  the agrochemical business. Subsequently the\ncompany filed a broad-spectrum insecticide, Chlorantraniliprole (CTPR) in India\nfor which it expects approval from agricultural ministry shortly. \n\n\nThe company\nhas invested ~100 crore in this segment till date. Additionally, the company\nhas filed another Agro product (undisclosed) recently. Overall, the management\nexpects this segment to contribute ~10-15% of overall revenues 2-3 years\ndown the line. The Investment is done for following purposes. \n·       Veda - to get insight of agrochemical\ndistribution.\n·       OMRV - for getting an understanding\nof the hospital space.\n·       AACT - for oncology drug discovery. \n     \n      3. Key\nProducts in the Portfolio\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPara-IV Filing Products in The Pipeline about\nto get Approvals and Launch in next few Years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n       Focused\napproach in US Natco has carved out its own identity via tie-ups to tap limited\nbut niche products pipeline including 20 Para IVs filings (FY20). As per the\nrevised and more feasible game plan, it plans to market products via tie-ups\nwith established players in the generic space.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Till FY19,\nthe company had filed 51 ANDAs, which includes some niche FTF opportunities.\nOverall, the management expects one or two complex product launches in the US. \n\n\n     4. New Launches\nin CND/Oncology to Drive Domestic Revenues \n\n\n     Natco is a\nleading player in the domestic oncology segment with a product basket of\n33 products (FY20). Company expect momentum in oncology segment to\ncontinue on the back of incremental launches amid pricing pressure in some\nproducts. New launches in cardio/diabetology segment (CND) is also expected to\nsupport overall growth. Going ahead, the company is looking to launch six to\neight products a year.\n     The\ncompany has launched around 5 products in Q1FY21 and plans to launch\ncumulatively 10-12 products in FY21 domestically. R&D productivity is lower amid\nCovid-related challenges. The company has adequate capacity for Oseltamivir\nacross two sites (one in India, another in US). Good pipeline of oncology\nproducts. Focusing on chemistry-based molecules as opposed to monoclonals (mAb).\n\n\n      5. Products\nThat Will Drive Future Growth \n\n\n      Driven by 3-4\nproducts such as Copaxone, Doxil, Lanthanum carbonate. Export growth due to\nstocking of two main Covid products. Oseltamivir + chloroquine (Lower margin\nproducts). API growth also led by demand for these APIs. Agrochem – 10-15% of\nrevenues over next two to three years.\n\n\n      Niche high\nvalue – 3 registered (1 being CTPR), some in pipeline (a) CTPR can be launched\nin the Rabbi season depending on court rulings and approvals. Commodity\nproducts – more than 6 filed. Over the next 2-3 years domestic agro business to\ngrow significantly, maybe start exports. Over 30% market share in Copaxone. Non-US\nsubsidiaries contributing ~12-13% to consolidated earnings.\n       \n     6. Revenue Growth\nTrend over the Years\n      \n\n\n      \n      7. What Makes Natco Face in the Crowd?\n\n\n       Differentiated\nmodel - Natco\nfollowed a different path for the US market – targeting select opportunities\nwith limited competition translating into high margins and generating\nsignificant cash flows.\n\n\n\nThe product\nportfolio is focused on complex products or litigation related opportunities.\nNatco’s successfully delivered four key opportunities Tamiflu, Doxil, Fosrenol, Copaxone which the company commercalized through its partners over\na 11-month period from Dec-2016 to Oct- 2017.\n\n\n8. US Filings\nSummary in Brief \n\n\nCompany has mapped\n16 product filings. These products fall into three categories: \n(a)\nOpportunities with case settlements and reasonably clear launch timelines - Revlimid March-2022, Kyprolis 2027, Nexavar (likely launch post Jan-2020). \n(b) Filings,\nwhich in their assessment are not lucrative anymore: Zytiga, Sovaldi, Tarceva. \n(c) Filings\nwhich are diffecult to assess, where outcome is dependent on the court verdict\n- Pomalyst, Tracleer. In terms of timelines, Afinitor and Nexavar should be\nwatched.\n\n\nRevlimid\n- The next big US\napproval will be Revlimid while there are handful of other US approvals and\nlaunches lined up. In Canada, the trial for Revlimid commenced in July.\nRegarding the US filing, the company has responded to all the queries raised by\nUSFDA and incremental inspection is not expected. The management is hoping for\na positive news by next quarter.\n\n\n9. Research\nand Development – Place where Innovation Happens\n\n\nCompany has\nover 40 R&D laboratories in 2 research and development facilities with a\ntalent pool of over 500 scientists. Company is having capabilities span\nsynthetic chemistry of small molecules, peptide chemistry, oligonucleotides,\nnanopharmaceuticals and new drug discovery. R&D productivity was lower in FY20 amid Covid-related\nchallenges. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Segmental\nOverview for the FY 20\n\n\n\nDomestic\nbusiness: The\ndomestic business was severely impacted as the Oncology and Hep-C businesses\nwere affected due to lower demand from patients. The management has\nguided for 8-10 product launches in FY21 given the current\nsituation. On a longer-term horizon, the guidance is 10-12\nlaunches per year. \n\n\nOncology\nbusiness -  NATCO’s product portfolio is among the\nmost extensive in the Indian oncology market, with 33 active products as on\n31st March, 2020. The business was down as immunosuppressed cancer\npatients can be highly vulnerable to Covid-19, leading to fewer hospital\nvisits. The oral oncology business (contributing 65-70% to Oncology business)\nis coming back but chemotherapy business (contributing 30-35% to Oncology\nbusiness) is yet to be back as the hospital visits are still sparse. \nPricing\npressure is seen easing in this year which was there in 2019. EBITDA margin of\nthe Oncology business is higher than consolidated company EBITDA margin. The\nCompany’s revenues from this business segment fell from 3,968 million in FY\n2018-19 to 3,078 million in FY 2019-20, primarily due to certain macro\npressures.\nExport\nbusiness - The\nexports (including FDFs and APIs) to the US clocked revenue of 7,834 million\nin FY 2019-20. NATCO is positioned strongly in its business in the US, which is\nprimarily driven by the continued growth of revenue coming from Glatiramer\nAcetate and Liposomal Doxorubicin.\nThe export\nbusiness is growing and is offsetting the underperformance of the domestic\nbusiness. The business has grown due to company having Chloroquine and\nOseltamivir in portfolio, growth in oral oncology and stocking up due to Covid-19\npandemic. \nAPI - For over two decades, Company has\ndemonstrated technical and operational expertise in developing and\ncommercialising more than 40 niche APIs. Company’s key therapeutic domain is\noncology and company is extending  expertise\nto include CNS and pain management. 49 Cumulative DMFs filed 39 Active\nDMFs. \nRevenues\nfrom the API division during FY 2019-20 stood at 3,552 million as compared to 3,019 million in FY 2018-19. As of 31st March, 2020, NATCO has a total\nof 49 active DMFs with the USFDA for products in the areas of oncology,\ncardiology and orthopaedic therapies. Company filed for four DMFs for the US\nmarket in FY 2019-20. \n\n\nAgrochemicals\nbusiness: NATCO has forayed into the agrichemical space through its\nCrop Health Sciences Division recently. Currently it is in the process to\ncomplete the manufacturing facilities for both technical (active ingredient)\nand formulations. \nThe company\nhas filed 1 product and approval takes roughly 10-12 months. The company will\nbe adopting a similar business model to what it does in the pharma division and\nchallenging patents will also be a part of business strategy. \n\n\nChina - The company has 4-5 filings under\nreview in China and couple of approvals are expected in the current fiscal\nyear. \n\n\n11. Capital\nExpenditure – To Cater the near-Term Demand\n\n\nDuring the\nyear, Company incurred capital expenditure of 3,492.85 million, a majority of\nwhich was used to enhance capabilities in Company’s manufacturing facilities. A\nsignificant portion of this capex was done at their Vizag facility. The\nremaining part was primarily used in formulation facilities across the country.\n\n\n12.

Formulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n•      \nEU grew 2.2% cc\nduring the year, in line with the industry. FY 20 reported strong recovery with\na 7% growth driven by nutrition business from Spain.

The production animal segment accounts for a\nlarger pie of 60% and the balance 40% is companion animals.

The project in Germany will\nstart late as vendors will not be ready with orders in July (the initial\ntimeline).\n5) Capacity expansion of Vizag facility\n\n    Sequent claims the Mahad site as the\nworld’s largest facility making a widely used antiparasitic agent. API revenue grew at CAGR of 56% over FY17-20 on the back of strong\nvolume growth of 35% during the same period. Given the strong demand outlook,\nthe company is expanded Albendazole capacity by 33% which will provide strong\nheadroom to tap growing demand for the product.\n     SSL has a capacity of 225 KL at Vizag and are in the process of expanding the same to 350 KL. This\nwill enable them to ramp up production volumes significantly in 2022.\n6) Carlyle\nGroup – To drive Growth in Future\n\n\n\n\n\n•   The Carlyle group\nhas strong healthcare side with investments around the world. The Carlyle group\nwill help the company in fast-tracking growth in the US and China. Key benefits\nalso include higher networking and better talent acquisition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n•    The Carlyle\nGroup has signed up to acquire a majority 74% stake in\nMumbai-headquartered animal health care company Sequent Scientific for over Rs\n1,500 crore.\n•       The\ntransaction is being done through an equity purchase stake that values each\nshare at Rs 86. The deal will be executed through two investment vehicles — CA\nHarbor Investments, affiliated entity of Mauritius, which is an\naffiliated entity of Carlyle. \n•  The Carlyle Group\nhas entered into a definitive agreement with the existing promoters of Sequent\nScientific to acquire a majority stake and up to 74% in the company, including\nup to 26% equity shares from public shareholders. \n•     This is an\ninflection point in the journey of the company as a Sequent can now leverage\nCarlyle's global network and resources to move to the next bit of growth and\ninnovation. \n•  Carlyle is no\nstranger to the Indian healthcare market, with a history of investing in the\nhealthcare sector, both in India and globally, fuelled by deep understanding of\nthe market, and an ability to create value through its operational expertise\nand close partnership with management. \n•     This transaction\nis their largest control deal in India and is reflective of their confidence,\nboth on the sector, as well as the business model of Sequent.\n•      \nIt’s believed\nwith Carlyle as the new promoter group, Company is well poised to the new phase\nof development, where Sequent together with Carlyle will work to grow into one\nof the top global animal health care company. \n7) Roadmap\nfor API & Formulations\na. Growth\n- API\n•     Focus on regulated\nmarkets/customers and high value products continues to drive up fixed asset\nturn for the business, now 2.5x for Q4 20 (annualised) and 2.4x for FY 20.\n•     Alivira is the #\n1 Generic Animal Health USVMF Filer and # 3 Global Animal Health USVMF filer. Filed\n2 Cox-2 inhibitor API in US making Alivira the only VMF filer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      b. Growth –\nFormulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    New multi-dosage R&D facility established\nin Mumbai to build regulated market pipeline 10 new filings in US in next 3\nyears. First time capabilities established to execute Ecotoxicity and Bio\nEquivalence studies in India First US injectable filed in FY20 for world’s\nlargest animal health injectable product. \n       The first injectable was launched in the European markets and the\nsame is expected to be launched in the US in FY22. The company currently does\nnot have a direct presence in the US, which it is looking to build through\nacquisition which will be helped by the Carlyle group deal. Filed world’s\nlargest animal injectable product in EU and US with an addressable global\nmarket of ~USD 350mn.\n\n\n\n\nGeographical\nScenario\n\n\n\n\n\nUS business: The Company expects the pipeline in the US to\nfructify from FY22 to FY24. All deliverables are on the API side and hence\ngrowth in the API business will be driven by the US business. After 18 months,\nthe company will start launching formulations in the US with the launch of the\nblockbuster injectable project.\nEurope business: The European business grew 2.2% (CC), which\nrepresents growth in line with the broad market. The injectable product will be\nlaunched in 11 European geographies by the end of November this year. In\ngeographies like France, where the company doesn’t have a strong presence, the\ncompany will launch injectable both individually as well with partner. The\ncompetitive intensity for the product should be mild with about 3-4 players. \nTurkey market: The Turkey business showed a 66.9% growth in\nFY20, which signifies that the regulatory issues are behind.\n8) Well\nestablished relationship with Global Majors \n       SSL’s\ncustomer profile consists of global majors across both animal and human health\nsegments. Under the veterinary segment, the company continues to supply its\nproducts to 8 out of the top SSL’s customer profile consists of global\nmajor’s animal health companies including Zoetis Inc, Merck Animal Health,\nBayer Animal Health, Virbac, Ceva, Vetoquinol, Boereinger Ingelheim, etc. \n       By virtue of\nits large customer base, the company’s customer concentration is moderate\nthereby mitigating the risk of order volatility. Established relationships with\na wide base of customers coupled with the regular addition of customers have\nsupported the healthy revenue growth of the company over the years. \n      Going\nforward, the company’s customer concentration is likely to reduce on the back\nof the company’s efforts to enter into newer products across segments in\naddition to catering to new customers across geographies.  \n9) Extraordinary\npresence across the Globe \n       Company has\nsteadily built a diversified portfolio of 1,000+ finished dosage formulations\n(FDF) across 12 dosage forms. Their therapeutic segments include feed supplements,\nantibiotics, anthelmintics, antibacterial, skincare (dermatology) products and\ndisinfectants with more products in the pipeline. Company is market leaders in\nsegments like intra mammaries, spot-on and pour-on.\nSources: Sequent Scientific Limited - Annual Reports, Investor Presentation, Con-Call Transcripts                        B P Wealth Initiating Coverage Report. \n\n\n Disclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Syngene International Limited -  Company Overview\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nLink to FY 2020-21 Annual Report takeaways - https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/10/syngene-international-ltd-fy2020-21.html\n1. Company Overview\n\nIncorporated in 1994 as a subsidiary of Biocon,\nSyngene International (SIL) is a leading contract research organization (CRO),\nwhich supports R&D programs of global innovative companies\n \nSIL offers outsourced services to support\ndiscovery and development for organizations across industrial sectors like\npharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, animal health,\nagro-chemicals, etc. It currently caters to 293 global players including\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Abbott, Baxter and Amgen, among others. SIL derives\n95% of its revenues from exports. Mangalore API plant is constructed and\nvalidation is expected to be completed in FY21. In FY20, Syngene extended its biologics discovery and preclinical\nresearch capabilities in CAR-T therapy, an innovative cell-based approach to\ntreat cancer.\n\n\nReceived approval from the Russian Ministry of Health the approval\nprocess was triggered as a result of a 4-year project with a Russian customer\nin which Syngene supported in the development and supply of multiple,\nmodified-release tablet formulations of a multiple sclerosis drug. \n\n\n\n\n2. Integrated business model – Ground\nfor customer stickiness\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues grew at ~16% CAGR in FY16-20 to\nRs. 2012 crore due to new client addition on a regular basis and scaled up\nrevenues from existing clients led by integrated service offerings, high data\nintegrity ethos and continuous endeavour to move up the value chain.\nEight of the top 10 global pharma companies\nhave been availing services for the last five years. It has a pool of 4240\nscientists. The client base has grown from 256 to 362 over FY16-20. \n3. Segmental\nGrowth Year on Year from past 3 years\n\n\n\n\nCRAMS and R&D\ngrowth, Biologics is also in line for growth traction sequentially Revenue\nincreased 13% YoY to INR17.5b (in-line) in FY20, mainly led by strong growth in\nBiologics (+31% YoY, 34% of sales) and Small Molecules (+16% YoY, 31% of\nsales). Research Services (30% of sales) grew 11% YoY to INR5.2b. However,\nBranded Formulations (9% of sales) de-grew by 26% YoY.\n\n\n\n\n4. Rapid Increase in Revenue - Trend over the Years \n\n\n\n\nSource: Company\n\n\nGrowth driven by increase in sales from\nexisting clients and acquisition of new clients\n\n\n\nEngage, expand and extend strategy to\nextend client relationship over a longer period of time \n\n\n\n\nGrowth in total number of clients \n\n\n\n\nIncrease in average revenue from largest\nclients \n\n\n\n\nIncrease in number of services offered\nto clients\n\n\n\n5. Increase in number of Clients\n\n\n\n6. Increase in number of Number of Asset\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Capital Expenditure\n\n\n\n\nOn a US$550 million program that\nwas spread over multiple years, the last year of which is FY21, it’s expected\nto be fully invested with all US$550 million by the end of this year. During\nthe last 12 months, the company added US$108 million of that capex. With this\ncapital infusion, company’s fixed assets currently stand at US$425 million.\nThis includes an asset under construction of US$70 million.\nCompany is very much on track to\nhave a total asset base of US$550 million by the end of the FY21. Capex in FY20 stood at 108mn USD,\nof which\n• 43mn USD in API\n• 28mn USD in Discovery\n• 12mn in Biologics\n• 25mn USD in others\n• Total gross block stands at\n451mn USD including 33mn USD of CWIP\n• It commissioned a new research\nfacility (152K sq. ft.) supporting biology, QC microbiology and other research\ndomains.\n• It is currently working at 70%\nutilization and expects to hit 100% by end of May.\n• It expects to achieve at least\n1x asset turnover with revenue build-up by second\nyear of asset\n• Revenue build-up for\nmanufacturing will take longer\n\n\n\n8. Mangalore Facility\n\n\nIn FY 20\nthe company capitalized their Mangalore API plant which is reflected in the\nnumber.US$100 million from the past was the total money company estimated for\nthe fully expanded capitalized plan. The US$75 million corresponds to the\ncurrent level of execution that company has targeted by FY21. But the company\nplans in a later stage to expand it further. Total Capex\nin the plant is USD 75mn and will be depreciated over 18yrs. \n•\nConstruction is now completed\n• It is in\nvalidation phase\n• It\nexpects to commence GMP commercial operations towards end FY21\n\n9. Scientist Count\n\n\nScientist strength addition, the company has\ntypically added between 450 to 500 people on an annual basis over the last five\nyears. Now in FY20, the company added about 240 to 250 people. Syngene\nstill has large room to grow in terms of scientists. \n\n\n\n\n10. R&D Centres – Growth Engines\n\n\nTo maintain the structural balance and\nimprove profitability, they are inclined to outsource a substantial part of the\nR&D work. Similarly, the innovative/virtual companies that are extensively\nworking on new products and which may not have the required capital/manpower\nalso tend to outsource a substantial part of their R&D.\n\n\nTrack record\nin acceptance of Recent Approvals\n \n●     \nNow one of Syngene’s\nstrengths is their strong track record of regulatory compliance and over the\ncourse of the last year, they have cleared audits not only by their  clients, but also by regulators from across\nthe globe and that includes the US FDA, the European EMEA, Japanese PMDA and\nothers. \n \n●     \nCollaborations and\npartnerships to deliver numerous clinical candidates. Delivery history for\nintegrated CMC programs towards FIH and beyond. Company has recently been\napproved for selling oral formulations in Russian markets.\n \n●     \nIt successfully cleared USFDA inspection\nof the small molecule bioanalytical laboratory within the clinical development\nservice line with no observations. The company commissioned the first phase of\na new research facility in Bengaluru that will house discovery biology, QC\nmicrobiology and other research capabilities.\n \n●     \nSyngene undertaking manufacturing of\ninnovator drug APIs. It increases its revenue base, and also helps it offer\nbundled and diversified services to its customers.\n\n\n●     \nThe company remains aggressive on the\ncapex front (~US$463 million already spent & another ~US$87 million\nearmarked by FY21), attributable to order book visibility.\n\n\n●     \nWith elite client additions like\nAmgen, Zoetis, Herbalife, GSK, etc, and multiple year extension of BMS and\nBaxter contracts, the company remains well poised to capture opportunities in\nthe global CRO space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●     \nThe management has guided for\ndouble-digit revenue growth on the back of continuous client additions, an\nextension of existing contracts, increasing manufacturing and biological\ncontributions besides currency tailwinds.\n  \nSource: Syngene Annual Report & Investor Presentation\n              Jefferies Research Report\n              Axis Research Report \n\n\n Disclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Hikal\n– Company Overview\n\n\nShuchi.P.Nahar\nTwitter: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nLink to my previous blog for detail explanation on \nWhat are CDMO and their wide scope:\n\n\n1. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com\n/2020/07/what-is-so-attractive-about-cdmos-in.html \n2. https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com\n/2020/07/a-masterclass-on-global-custom.html\n\n\n1. Company Overview\n\n\nEstablished\nin 1988, Hikal is predominantly a B2B player that provides intermediates and\nactive ingredients to global pharmaceutical, animal health, crop protection and\nspecialty chemical companies. Hikal today is one of the leading global\nsuppliers to the Life Sciences industry. Company is having six sites providing\na multitude of services across the value chain. \n\n\n\n\nFigure:1 Business Snapshot\n\nThe\npharma business is currently divided almost equally between generic active\npharma ingredients (APIs) and contract development and manufacturing\norganisation (CDMO) businesses. Leading Sustainable Technology driven company\nserving the Crop Protection & Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\n\nFigure:2 Company Overview\n\n\n2.  Revenue Growth Trend over the Years\n\n\n      Figure:3 Hikal's Revenue Trend\n      Source: Company's Investor Presentation\n\n\n\n       Hikal recorded a total turnover of ₹\n15,073 million as compared to ₹ 15,896 million in FY 2019-20, a decrease of 5.2%. The\ncrop protection division witnessed a sales de-growth from ₹ 6,505 million in FY\n2018-19 to₹ 6,204 million in FY 2019-20, a decline of 4.63%. The pharmaceutical\ndivision witnessed a sales de-growth from ₹ 9,391 million in FY 2018-19 to₹\n8,869 million in FY 2019-20, a decline of 5.56%. The reason for this\nperformance is largely attributable to de-stocking at the customers end which\nresulted in lower volumes during the year.\n\n\n      3. Research & Development –Principal Growth\nDriver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Figure:3 Increase in R&D Expense Year on Year\n     Source: Company's Investor Presentation\n\n\n\nI     Innovation\nacross processes and strong research capabilities have been made possible\nthrough our dedicated team of ~250 scientists. Annually, we invest about 3-4%\nof our total sales in R&T.\n\n·       \nCommercialize\n3-4 DMF’s in 2019-20 for our generic API portfolio. \n\n·       \nContinue\nto generate our own IP through Process Patents\n\n·       \nFiled\n2 DMFs (Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin) as part of our proprietary portfolio\nin the pharmaceutical division, one veterinary master file (VMF) and one\ncertificate of suitability (CEP) for Europe \n\n·       \nThe\nVMF is for an antiparasitic active ingredient for veterinary use. The CEP is\nfor Flunarizine which is a migraine prevention medication\n\n·       \nR&T\nfacility in Pune and Development and Launch plant (DLP) in Bangalore delivered\nseveral contract development and manufacturing projects successfully \n\n·       \nIn\nefforts to develop DLP further, we have filed a DMF from this site \n\nDeveloped a new API\nusing an enzymatic process which is both cost-effective and environmentally\nfriendly.\n\n\n      4. Pharmaceuticals – Important Business\nSegment\n\n\n\n      Figure:4 Pharmaceuticals Business Overview\n      Invested\nsignificantly in the generic API business both in terms of personnel and\nmanufacturing capabilities. Company has strengthened their R&D\ninfrastructure by starting a solid-state chemistry lab that will help them\nserve customers better in terms of getting the right polymorphs and particle\nsizes of API’s. Contract manufacture two large volume molecules,\na neuropathic pain reliever and an anticholesterol molecule\nexclusively for a leading US based innovator Company. Expecting the volumes of\nboth these molecules to continue to grow in the coming year. \n      \n       Gabapentin\n(CNS) is the largest product that contributes ~40% to total pharma sales.\nThe pharma business is mainly export-oriented with ~55% of sales derived from\nthe US, 30% from Europe and the balance from the rest of the world (RoW).\n      \n      5. Animal Health Business – A Natural\nProgression\n       Hikal continues its focus on growing the animal health business. Our exclusive\nmanufacturing contract with a leading US-based veterinary drug innovator\nfor a non-antibiotic veterinary drug API was stable in terms of volume\nthis past year. Hikal completed the scale up validation of a niche pain\nmanagement veterinary drug.  \n      Company\nplans to commercialise several advanced intermediates for a new generation\nectoparasitic API that belongs to the isoxazoline group. Successfully filed a\nVMF for an antiparasitic active ingredient used in veterinary medicine in\nlivestock and pets against internal parasites. Company has developed a process\nfor the preparation of a leading flea and tick medicine.\n      \n\n      Figure: 5 Animal Healthcare Overview \n     \n6. Crop Protection - Bodes Well for the Company\n       \n\n      Figure:6  Crop Protection Overview\n\n      Company’s Crop\nProtection CDMO segment has 2-3 products in the pipeline currently.\nThese are all early stage products. Overall, product pipeline is healthy. Over\nthe years, it has increased its product offerings with a foray into niche\nproducts and specialty chemicals.\n      During the\nfinancial year, a project on organophosphorus chemistry was developed and\ndelivered. Company also scaled up and successfully commercialised\na biocide product. This was done while company continued developing\nprocesses for 2 new products, expected to be commercialised in the next few\nyears. Additionally, a new process for a novel fungicide was also developed for\nan innovator company and is due for commercialisation next year.\n7. Capex – Long Term Horizon\n        At Hikal,\nthey have a capex programme running across both their segments, aggregating to\naround ₹ 3,000 million, which is targeted towards capacity addition and\nupgradation of infrastructure across facilities. As of 31\nMarch 2020, company has already invested ₹ 1,580 million and the\nbalance capex cycle is expected to get completed in 2020-21. The capex is\ntargeted towards multi-product plants providing us with flexibility to\nmanufacture various products. \n       About 40-55% of this new capacity will be\nabsorbed by existing products and balance capacity will be utilised for\nnew products. The current capex programme would have a blended asset turnover of\napproximately 1.5 times, once completed.\n\n\n       References: 2019-20 Hikal's Annual Report & Q1FY21, Q4FY20  Investor Presentation\n       Disclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Neuland Laboratories Limited -  Company Overview \nShuchi.P.Nahar - @shuchi_nahar\nNeuland is a leading manufacturer of active\npharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and an end-to-end solution provider for the\npharmaceutical industry’s chemistry needs. The Company operates in the market\nusing two main business models - Generic Drug Substances (GDS) where they cater\nto the needs of the Generic players and Custom Manufacturing Solutions (CMS)\nwhere they primarily work with innovators by helping them bring critical\nproducts to the market. CDMO is the emerging growth segment of the company with\n13 to 17 Molecules in development phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.    \nBusiness Performance\nNeuland\nlab (NLL) has posted revenue of INR 2,054mn with 13.5% YoY increase, which was\n4% below. The revenue growth was mainly driven by the CMS segment, led by 32\nmolecules (Development + Commercialize) with speciality API segment, which grew\nby 33.2% in Q1FY21. EBITDA margin expanded by 622bps to 16.5% level, which was\n219bps higher than our estimate driven by 580bps improvement in gross margin\nled by improved product mix. \nManagement\nis confident to improve margin profile from current level on the back of strong\norder book in CMS business, better traction in GDS business and cost\noptimization measures. In terms of emerging CDMO player Company has couple of\nmolecules go up from 13 to about 17 in the development Phase-and from 14 to\nabout 15 in our commercialization phase. Some of these molecules are generating\npart of the growth & some of the revenue growth is also coming from the\nincrease in the number of projects itself. Most of the molecules are in their\nlast phase of approval, that means there are more chances of approvals coming\nin years. API & CMS both have healthy pipeline for future growth. \n2.      Revenue\nGrowth 2019 v/s 2020 \n\n\n\nRevenue in\nthe year 2019 was Rs. 670 Cr. Of which 54% was contributed from Prime Segment,\n25% from Niche/Speciality Segment, 14% from CMS Segment and rest 7% from others\nRevenue in the year 2020 was Rs. 766 Cr. Of which 46% was contributed from\nPrime Segment, 27% from Niche/Speciality Segment, 21% from CMS Segment and rest\n6% from others.\n\n\n3.     Key\nOperating Metric – CMS Revenue Split\n\n\n\n\n4.    \nR&D\nExpenditure\n\n\nIn terms of\nexpense 2% R&D as a proportion to revenue. The R&D team has been a\ncrucial partner in the growth of the CMS business managing the spike in number\nof projects while also making significant contribution in terms of Process\nImprovement & Development (PID) work for the GDS business. \nA pilot\nplant has been commissioned at Unit III, which enables our team to further\naccelerate the process of development of new products. \nUnit III is\nbeing operationalized which will add to the capacity and revenues from FY21.\nCompany commissioned a pilot plant at Unit III for use by the R&D team. It\nwill primarily be used to manufacture engineering/ development batches. \n5.    \nRegulatory Filings by the Company till Date\nin various Countries \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         880+ DMFs filed. \n\n\n\n      300+ API processes developed.\n\n\n\n\n      204+ patents filed. \n\n\n\n\n      Received USPTO patent for improved process\nsynthesis of Paliperidone Palmitate.\n\n\n\n\n6.    \nInvestment\nCapital\ninvestment during the year stood at 347.18 lacs. The Company enriched its\nassets pool with new XRPDs, HPLCs, ICP MS, LCMS, and PSD equipment. This would\nhelp increase project management and document filing capability. \nIt’s expected\nthe contribution from the high-volume segment to be gradually replaced with the\nCMS segment and to register healthy revenue growth of 26.6% over FY20-22,\nfuelled by the ramp-up in supplies of existing products and possible\ncommercialization of products in clinical trials. \n7.    \nNo of CMS Active Projects Increasing\n\n\n\n8.    \nManagement Guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Capex for FY21: INR700-INR 800mn.\n\n\n\n\n     Unit 3: To fully commercialize from Aug 20,\nexisting capacity sufficient to cater 2-3 years revenue. growth Awaiting more\nclarification from government on incentive scheme for API manufacturing. \n\n\n\n\n    NLL\nhas 4 APIs out of 53 critical APIs where India has a large dependence on China.\n\n\n\n\n     Remain\noptimistic about the growth of CMS business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.    \nFuture\nOutlook\nThere is a lot of traction on the CMS new projects as well as good growth\nin the baseline of the CMS business which is the traditional whole CMS company\nhad for several years. \nThe outlook remains positive especially because the two markets that Neuland\nis focusing on Japan and North America and their pipeline of opportunity looks\nquite strong the pipeline of projects that have entered the system in the last\n3 to 6 months are quite advanced in nature, like say 3 molecules are about to\nget into commercial. \nThese are opportunities which have a shorter cycle for commercialization.\nSo, unlike say 4-5 years ago, where the company was mostly engaged in phase I,\nphase II projects now they are all in the last phase and they would go through\na natural attrition and a long cycle.\n \nReferences: Neuland\nAnnual Report 2019-20 & 2018-19\n                     Neuland Investor\nPresentation & Conference Call Transcripts\n \n \n \n \nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for\neducational purposes only.

    "summary": "Biosimilars - The upcoming trend in Pharmaceutical Sector\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\n\n1. What are the trends impacting the global pharmaceutical sector?\n\n\n\n\n\n2. How are Biosimilars different from Small Molecules?\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of Small Molecule and Biosimilars\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Molecule Size - Small Molecules to Biologics\n\n\n3. Procedure for Biosimilar US FDA Approval \n\n\nBiologics contain active substances derived from living cells or organisms, the development of a biosimilar is much more complex than the process for developing a generic drug. A biosimilar requires the creation of a new manufacturing process and a custom cell line since the reference product’s manufacturing process is proprietary and not publicly available. \n\nDue to the complex nature and production methods of biologics, relatively minor changes in manufacturing processes may significantly affect product quality, safety, and the criteria by which similarity is determined.\n\n*Below (Figure 3) is just an illustrative example for the approval procedure of Pegfilgrastim biosimilar, which gives an idea about the time required for a biosimilar to develop and reach the markets.\n\n\n\nDevelopment Process of Biosimilar in US  Market\n*An illustrative example for the procedure for Biosimilars approval\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Step by Step Development Process\n(Source: BIOCON - Biopharmaceutical Company )\n\n\nA biosimilar may require more analytical characterization and nonclinical studies than reference products, it may need fewer clinical trials and clinical pharmacology studies than its reference product to obtain FDA approval. Due to this reliance on the FDA’s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, a biosimilar may have a shorter and less costly development program.\n\n4. Evolution of Biosimilars and their approvals in US market in last few years\nSince the first biosimilars entered the US marketplace in 2015, 28  products have been approved to date. The US marketplace is poised to welcome many new biosimilars from 2019-2022, spurring competition that will potentially lead to significant savings for the healthcare system. Essential components of provider and patient use of biosimilars include addressing the clinical, operational, and economic considerations to drive adoption as well as payer coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Evolution of Biosimilars and rising approvals\nSource: Bill of Health - Harvard Law\n\nBiosimilars have a bright future if additional work is done to be attractive to prescribers and payers. Trends show that providers are already aware of biosimilars and are interested in learning more about them. Similarly, payers are showing a desire to adopt biosimilars to foster a successful marketplace and realize savings. From the above chart, we can see the evolution in Biosimilar approvals that have accelerated in past years and will continue for the Long term in the future. This thesis can be supported by the below (Figure: 4) that shows the increase in biotechnology % Prescription & OTC Sales.\n\nWorldwide Prescription Drug & OTC Pharmaceutical Sales\n\n\nFigure 5: Biotech vs. Conventional Technology \n\nSource: Evaluate Pharma -World Preview 2020\n\nBiotechnology products are forecast to take the majority share in the top 100 drugs by sales by 2026, with 55% of the total top 100 product sales in 2026, up 16% compared to 2012. Global prescription sales of biotech products to grow with a CAGR of 9.6% between 2019 & 2026, compared to conventional product growth of 5.5%. Biotech products are forecast to take a 55% share of the total top 100 product sales in 2026. The above chart justifies the increasing trend of biotechnology in coming years whose evolution has already started from the year 2017 onwards.\n\n5. Opportunities & Market Size for Biosimilars\nThe global biosimilars market size is expected to grow by $240 billion by 2030. In today’s emerging markets, biosimilars are still nascent, with little presence.\n\n\nHowever, in contrasting emerging markets with developed markets, the limited patient access\nto affordable biologics and the openness of physicians to low-cost therapies may offer potentially significant opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe industry continues to shift towards \nBiotechnology\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Worldwide Prescription Drug & OTC Sales by Technology (2012-2026) \nSource: Evaluate Pharma -World Preview 2020\n\nAs the number of prescription drugs expected to rise from $940bn (FY20) to $1432 bn (FY26), there is a positive outlook for biosimilars. The FDA appears to recognize the need to evolve standards over time. As biosimilar manufacturers and regulators gain experience and confidence, and technology advances, this kind of flexibility – grounded in science – will be important for fostering a thriving US biosimilars market. A maximally streamlined development, application, and approval process will be all the more vital for biosimilars of orphan or small-market biologics. \n\nDeveloped markets, with the exception of the United States, represent the greatest biosimilars presence today Most biosimilars manufacturers have been and remain focused on the developed markets – whether it is for their historic and current opportunities (EU) or for their future market potential (United States, Japan). \n\n\n7. The greatest evolution for the pharma sector\nMore importantly, biosimilars and their originator products accounted for $40 billion in spending in 2019. This expenditure was across several key therapy areas where further biosimilar entry would significantly impact healthcare costs. Biosimilars have the potential for substantial system savings. Therefore, biosimilars spending is expected to reach $16-36 billion by 2024\n\n\nSource: Biocon Ltd. Annual Report\nThe recent upsurge in approval and launches of biosimilars, mainly in oncology, has boosted biosimilar penetration. Besides, small molecules continue to play a significant role in innovative treatments in oncology, diabetes, respiratory and autoimmune diseases and represent close to 60% of the total medicine spending compared to biologics.\n \nThere are listed Indian companies that have shown remarkable progress in biosimilars and have an exponential pipeline for the same that will result in good fortune in the coming times. To name the few they are:\n\nBiocon - U.S, Europe and ROW\n\nLupin - Europe\n\nDr. Reddy’s - Domestic Market\n\nCadila Healthcare - Domestic Market\n\nSyngene (CRO,CDMO & Biologics) - U.S, Europe and ROW\n\n\nReferences: ESMO Munich 2018\nLessons for the United States from Europe’s Biosimilar Experience - Matrix Global Advisors\nAMGEN Biosimilars\n Deloitte - Biosimilars Research Report\nEvaluate Pharma - World Outlook 2020\nBIOCON - Fulphila  BiosimilarDrug Approval Process \n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Nutraceuticals - The Next Gem of Healthcare Sector\nShuchi.P.Nahar\nTwitter: shuchi_nahar\n\n\n\nWhat is Nutraceuticals?\n\n\n\nThe term ‘nutraceuticals’ was firstly used in the late 1980s to describe food products that have a medicinal benefit. This fast-growing sector includes functional foods (such as vitamin-enriched products), nutritional supplements, sport drinks, and medically formulated foods. \n\n\nNutraceuticals and its Division\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The diagram showing the various divisions of Nutraceuticals \n\n\n\nScope\n\n\n\nNutraceuticals is expected to play a central role in preventative healthcare. The logic seems simple - an ageing population gives rise to lifestyle-related diseases, whose impact can be lessened by making healthier choices earlier in life. This convergence of medicine, food and technology is likely to create a battleground in which food and pharma companies compete for dominance of the sector. Successful companies will have to hit the bullseye in six main areas: technology, product strategy, compliance, marketing, supply chain management and corporate deal-making.\n\n\n\nFood and Pharmaceutical Company having different Edge over each other\n\n\n\nFood companies have a greater understanding than pharmaceuticals of nutrition and food formulation, plus decades of consumer research and relationships with mass-market distributors. \n\n\nPharmaceutical companies have strong research departments, stakeholder relationships and regulatory structures that enable them to generate new compounds, plus wider ties to the scientific community. Among the pharmaceutical companies with a strong presence in nutraceuticals, Abbott owns some of the leading nutritional product brands. Pfizer sells a range of dietary supplements. Johnson & Johnson makes products to lower cholesterol and dietary supplements for people who are lactose intolerant. The progress done by pharma companies is much faster than the food , due to enriched R&D facilities with the pharma companies.\n\n\n\n\nNutraceuticals gives an Exciting Opportunity to both Food & Pharmaceutical Companies\n\n\n\nBy complementing each other’s strengths (and weaknesses), a merger of the nutraceuticals portfolios of a big food company and a big pharmaceuticals company might make sense, but there hasn’t been a significant one yet. While both the company forays into nutraceuticals they can have benefits in themselves such as : \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Opportunities for Pharmaceutical Companies & Food Companies\n\n\n\nIndia’s Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals Market – An Overview\n\n\nSource: Deloitte Nutraceutical Report\nFigure 3: India Nutraceutical Market Growth till 2022 (USD Billion)\n\n\nThe term \"health supplements and nutraceuticals” is evolving and the nomenclature varies across countries. For e.g., Canada naming them natural and non-prescription health products, the USA calling them dietary supplements and Japan naming them “foods for special health use”. \n\n\nThis has resulted in different countries including different categories for defining “health supplements and nutraceuticals”.While the Indian market witnessed high growth rates in nutraceuticals, it is still a relatively small market global nutraceuticals industry. \n\n\nIndian nutraceuticals market constitutes nearly 2% of the global nutraceuticals market. It is expected to grow rapidly and account for 3% of the global share by 2022. Developed countries, including the US, Europe and Japan account for more than 90% of the global nutraceuticals market.\n\n\n\nKey Demand Drivers Leading to need and Growth of Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals in India\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Key Drivers for growth in Nutraceuticals in India\n\n\n\nElderly Population\n\nElderly population in India is expected to reach 143 million by 2021 from the current 100 million. With an ageing population, the chronic disease burden has also increased. India recorded 5.8 million deaths owing to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) in 2016, constituting 61% of total deaths.\n\n\n\nRapid Retail Growth\n\nIndia’s retail market is expected to double to US$ 1.3t by 2020 from US$600b in 2015. Increasing the number of supermarkets, health and wellness chains, etc. would increase the consumer's accessibility to nutraceutical products. A greater number of non-grocery retailers, such as drugstores, mass merchandisers and retail chains, etc. are expanding their selection in the food supplement space.\n\n\n\nTrend of Co-Prescription\n\nPenetration of functional F&B remains significantly lower when compared to developed economies of the world providing significant room for opportunity. In India, a multivitamin product is prescribed in 16% of the prescriptions. Multivitamins are increasingly being co-prescribed in indications such as chronic alcohol liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, stroke, sepsis among others.\nWith the increasing penetration of modern forms of retail including hyper and supermarkets, eCommerce channels, etc., the distribution landscape for functional foods & beverages is changing rapidly.\n\n\n\nChange in Consumption pattern & Urbanization  \n\nFocus on fitness and general well-being is leading consumers to intake food products that cater to their additional specific requirements such as proteins, antioxidants, vitamins, etc. With a rising urban population in India (33% in 2015, up from 27% in 1995) the consumption pattern has also changed in the nutraceuticals market. The traditional dietary supplements dominant market is now driven by functional foods. \n\n\n\nThe emergence of New Categories in Health & Wellness Space\n\nThere is an emergence of new niche categories such as anti-ageing, energy-boosting, skincare, digestive care, etc. are emerging as fast-growing categories. Additionally, an increased product penetration in existing categories such as fortified water in the health drink sub-segment, fortified noodles, variety of flavours in sports and energy drinks, etc. is likely to drive the demand for nutraceuticals over the next five years.\n\n\n7)  Future Growth and Opportunities\nThe Nutraceuticals market worldwide is projected to grow by US$135.4 billion, driven by a compounded growth of 7.2%. Functional Food & Beverages, one of the segments analysed and sized in this study, displays the potential to grow at over 7.5%.  Poised to reach over US$196.4 Billion by the year 2025, Functional Food & Beverages will bring in healthy gains adding significant momentum to global growth. While the Indian market witnessed high growth rates in nutraceuticals, it is still expected to have a long runway to reach. Indian nutraceuticals market constitutes nearly 2% of the global nutraceuticals market. It is expected to grow rapidly and account for 3% - 5%  of the global share by 2022.\nDeveloped countries, including the US, Europe and Japan account for more than 90% of the global nutraceuticals market. India’s nutraceuticals market is expected to double in size to US$ 1.27 billion by 2026, on account of the strong demand for dietary supplements from the upper and middle class.\nIndia, the fastest growing economy in the world, houses over 1.25 billion people and, as per the UN, is forecasted to become the most populated country by 2024. With the growing population, India, a developing country, faces challenges to ensure that there is not only adequate food supply but it also meets the required nutritional levels.\nSome Indian companies that are engaged in Nutraceuticals are:\n\n1) Syngene (Contract Manufacturing for Probiotics)\n2) Fairchem - Tocopherol Natural Vitamin-E\n3) Fermenta Biotech - Vitamin D3\n4) Advanced Enzymes - Human & Animal Nutritions\n5) Laurus Labs - Synthesis/ Ingredient(Dietary Supplements) Etc \n\nReferences:Ministry of food processing Industries - Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals\n Ministry of Ayush\n Deloitte - Nutraceuticals Market in India\n  Manufacturing units focused on niche  Nutraceuticals \n  KPMG - Nutraceuticals Future of intelligent food\n\n\n \nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

The logic seems simple - an ageing population gives rise to lifestyle-related diseases, whose impact can be lessened by making healthier choices earlier in life. This convergence of medicine, food and technology is likely to create a battleground in which food and pharma companies compete for dominance of the sector. Successful companies will have to hit the bullseye in six main areas: technology, product strategy, compliance, marketing, supply chain management and corporate deal-making.</span></span></p><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\"><br /></span><ol start=\"3\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; list-style-type: decimal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\">Food and Pharmaceutical Company having different Edge over each other</span></span></p></li></ol><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\">Food companies have a greater understanding than pharmaceuticals of nutrition and food formulation, plus decades of consumer research and relationships with mass-market distributors.&nbsp;</span></span></p><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\">Pharmaceutical companies have strong research departments, stakeholder relationships and regulatory structures that enable them to generate new compounds, plus wider ties to the scientific community.

    "summary": "In continuation with the previous blog here’s  the second part signifying the factors that are to be taken into consideration for understanding the growth of the Animal Healthcare Sector. \nSHUCHI. P. NAHAR\n\nLink to previous related article:\nhttps://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/08/animal-health-care-industry-future-ahead.html\n \nThe changing economic and climatic scenarios is globally fostering many hazards to livestock, poultry, aqua & companion animals which needs to be addressed more effectively and efficiently by veterinary professionals and animal health product manufacturers/distributors. This larger picture helps all members with a better understanding of Animal Health and encourages a scientific approach that facilitates the supply of innovative, cost effective and quality products & services.\n\nAnimal Healthcare - Industry Dynamics\n\nA ) Beneficial Pricing Environment \n\nUnlike the pricing landscape of human prescription medicines, where pricing pressure and price control have been the regulators and governments major weapon to control burgeoning healthcare costs, the animal health market has seen little direct government involvement. Unlike the human pharmaceutical industry where eventual buyers are insurance companies or the government in the animal health industry, buyers are pet owners and animal farm owners. This gives the government very little incentive to get involved in fixing prices. \n\nB ) Increasing R&D Productivity \n\nUnlike human health, the animal health industry is characterised by higher R&D productivity and shorter development time, as well as lower costs and risks. Animal health products generally show faster R&D timelines in all stages ranging from research to the regulatory review process. Hence, in aggregate total development timelines are typically 3 to 5 years faster than in human drug development. \n\nC ) Competitive Intensity \n\nCompetition is lower in the animal health industry. There is extremely limited overlap in the product portfolio of Top-10 companies. Market is dominated by the Big US and a few European players. \n\nD ) Global Scenario\n\nThe global population is growing at 0.75% p.a., which is expected to increase from 7.7 billion today to over 9.7 billion by 2050. This increased population cannot be fed by agriculture alone. Livestock farming automatically becomes a secondary yet important source of living. Second, population growth leads to increased demand for land, hence animal farms necessarily have to have enhanced productivity.\n\nGrowth drivers for Animal Healthcare Industry \n\nA ) Trend in Animal Husbandry around the World\n\nAnimal husbandry significantly contributes to the GDP of emerging nations around the world. Animals have been domesticated since 13,000 years. Even today, cattle such as cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep that provide milk and meat are the primary source of income in rural areas. Animal husbandry has become technology driven with rising demand on quality of animal products. Like all major industries, it has seen corporatisation resulting in attachment of control on animal infection outbreaks. This in turn has resulted in the growth of the animal healthcare market. \n\nB) Increase in Pet Adoption and Growing Technology\n\nIn the past few decades, there has been a significant expansion in pet adoption, especially amongst the elderly population. The increase in disposable income and increasing acceptability of animals as social companions has led to increase in pet ownership. Amongst some lonely elderly people, certain animal categories like dogs and parrots are seen as an alternative to human children, given their ability to respond to human emotions and signals. The growing number of pets will also boost the overall demand from the animal healthcare industry.\n\nC ) Protein Consumption \n\nIt is estimated that by 2030, to feed the global population, animal protein production will have to increase by 30% from its current volume. Without effective disease prevention and health management strategies, this could impact the meat and dairy industries in a big way. Post consideration of the increased interest in plant-based or lab-based meats and other protein alternatives, animal-based proteins will remain critical in meeting the demand of the world’s growing population. \n\nD ) Human Population Growth \n\nThe global population is growing at 0.75% p.a., which is expected to increase from 7.7 billion today to over 9.7 billion by 2050. This increased population cannot be fed by agriculture alone hence livestock farming is also simultaneously required. Second, population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity. \n\nE ) Improved Living Standards \n\nThere is increased focus on food quality and safety as standards of living improve, leading to higher demand for quality non-vegetarian food.\n\nTypes of Animal Healthcare\n\nThere are many more varieties of healthcare that have developed for animal health but here I would like to highlight the two most important segment of animal healthcare:               \n\n                   \n\nThe farm animal healthcare accounts for 62% shares in the entire veterinary healthcare market. Continued efforts are being made by the government with initiatives that help modernise agriculture through technology and continued scale consolidation. With that, stricter food safety/ quality improvements and environmental regulations have formed which are useful as well as easily adopted in many developing countries. \n\nGovernments globally have taken several steps for the development of farm health care animals. These include zero environmental impact of agricultural residues, over the course of the last five years by the Chinese government. Other Governments have enacted notably stringent environmental protection laws.  \n\nThe global farm animal healthcare market size was US$ 20.5 billion in CY2019. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% between 2019-2025 with North America being the largest market and Asia Pacific being the fastest growing market. \n\nCompanion Animal Healthcare \n\nBased on animal type, the market is fragmented into companion animals and livestock animals. Companion animals cover dogs, cats, horses, and others. The companion animals segment is poised to witness around 4% CAGR during the forecast timeframe. The segmental progress is majorly due to the growing number of pets and fast-changing technology implications.\n\nThe global companion animal market size in 2019 was worth US$ 12.54 billion and expected to reach US$ 19.18 billion by 2024 with a growth rate at a CAGR of 6.26%. The increase in the number of pets and importance of emphasis on animal healthcare and vaccination has led to an increase in the demand of animal healthcare products. Since pet owners realise that their animal companions are part of their own family, the level of care provided to these animals has significantly improved, thereby driving the growth of this market. \n\nRise in the income levels of individuals leveraging recent trends is leading to the increase in the number of pet (companion animal) adoption which ultimately leads to increase in the demand of companion animal healthcare. Additionally, advances in animal health medicines and vaccines, increased types of medical treatment are fostering the market growth of the companion animal healthcare market. \n\nThe companion animal healthcare market is extremely competitive with major players accounting for about 3/4th of the market. Given its highly competitive nature, several companies are focusing more on research and development to produce better pharmaceuticals and vaccine products for the existing and newly diagnosed diseases.\n\nSegregation through Animal Types\n\nPoultry \n\nPoultry had a short term hit due to the move from the large trend of 50:50 dine in, dine out to 90:10 dine in scenario. This has resulted in near-term supply chain realignment from box packaging to add-supermarket consumption. In a recession, consumers generally trade down a little bit on protein, resulting in slightly lesser meat consumption. However, the same still is expected to grow 1-2% as per past historical trends. It is expected that the same will be normalised in the coming months. \n\nPork \n\nChina has a huge demand for pork, which is imported from the USA, Brazil and other geographies. China will need to significantly ramp up protein imports during the next several years from the rest of the world given the ASF disease that decimated Chinese hog production in 2019 and materially reduced protein availability within the country. Pork demand has remained stable thus far. \n\nCattle \n\nIt is expected that the cattle population will be maintained for the dairy industry. Beef demand has shifted from restaurants to home dine in due to the former’s closure. As a result, a marginal decline has been noted so far and it is expected that the same trend will gradually become normal in the second half of 2020 with the recent reopening of restaurants in developed countries. \n\nFurther, cattle breeding and rearing is expected to remain constant since livestock owners know that it takes around 2 years to fully breed a cattle.        \n\nConclusions\n\nIn India, Animal Husbandry is making a significant contribution to the national economy and socio-economic development of the country. With 10.71% of world’s livestock population, India stands first in buffalo population, second in cattle and goat population, third in sheep, fifth in chicken and sixth in camel population world over with bovine population of 299.9 million, 135.17 million goats, 65.06 million sheep, 10.29 million pig, 0.4 million camels and 729.2 million poultry as per latest census.\n\nIndia stands number one in the world for total milk production with an estimated milk production of 140 million tonnes with an average yearly growth of over 4% and per capita milk availability of around 307 grams per day. Poultry industry which provides cheap sources of animal protein has taken a quantum leap in the last few decades evolving from a near backyard practice to a venture of industrial promotion. \n\n\nSource: Fitchratings.com\n               spglobal.com \n               Infah.org\n               Global Market Insights\n               Company A.R\n               Vetlineindia\n            \n             \n                       SHUCHI.P.NAHAR\n\n                                                                           \n\nFor more updates : @shuchi_nahar",

Animals have been domesticated since 13,000 years. Even today, cattle such as cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep that provide milk and meat are the primary source of income in rural areas. Animal husbandry has become technology driven with rising demand on quality of animal products. Like all major industries, it has seen corporatisation resulting in attachment of control on animal infection outbreaks. This in turn has resulted in the growth of the animal healthcare market.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">B) Increase in Pet Adoption and Growing Technology</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the past few decades, there has been a significant expansion in pet adoption, especially amongst the elderly population. The increase in disposable income and increasing acceptability of animals as social companions has led to increase in pet ownership. Amongst some lonely elderly people, certain animal categories like dogs and parrots are seen as an alternative to human children, given their ability to respond to human emotions and signals. The growing number of pets will also boost the overall demand from the animal healthcare industry.</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">C ) Protein Consumption</span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It is estimated that by 2030, to feed the global population, animal protein production will have to increase by 30% from its current volume. Without effective disease prevention and health management strategies, this could impact the meat and dairy industries in a big way. Post consideration of the increased interest in plant-based or lab-based meats and other protein alternatives, animal-based proteins will remain critical in meeting the demand of the world’s growing population.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">D ) Human Population Growth</span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The global population is growing at 0.75% p.a., which is expected to increase from 7.7 billion today to over 9.7 billion by 2050.

    "summary": "India Emerging as a Next Biologic Drug Hub\n\nSHUCHI.P.NAHAR\nThe Indian pharmaceutical companies always had strong chemistry skills to work on small molecules to make generic drugs, but they lacked skills, people and ecosystem to work on large molecules to come up with reverse engineered versions of biotech drugs, many experts complain. However, it is beginning to change.\n \n'India: the emerging hub for biologics and biosimilars', the Indian pharmaceutical companies have launched 123 biosimilars and currently have 201 active biosimilars covering multiple indications in the development pipeline.\nFurther, India has 95 approved biosimilars in the domestic market, more than any other country in the world.\nBiologics are the biological products regulated under the rules of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are used to either diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure various medical conditions. \nSignificantly, biologics are large, complex, and diverse molecules produced through biotechnology. And, this uses living systems including animal cells, plant cells or microorganisms. Some biologics are therapeutic proteins such as filgrastim, monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab,vaccines such as for influenza and tetanus, etc.\n\n\nMoreover, the main challenge of manufacturing biologics is the consequent inherent variations These variations of products have to be characterized with time. Therefore, the FDA assesses the manufacturer's strategy as well as the manufacturing procedure in order to control the product variations.\nThe biologic market is set to grow, with biologic drug sales forecast to increase from $239bn in 2018 to $493bn by 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11%, according to GlobalData’s Drug Sales and Consensus Forecast (DSCF) Database.\nFurthermore, with biologics making up 41% of pipeline drugs, combined with investor understanding of these drugs’ potential and ongoing attractive IPO conditions across all markets, we can expect to see further biologic IPOs in the very near future.\nBiologics are one of the top selling drugs worldwide  as well as in the United States but the major\ndrawback of this drug has been its exorbitant cost,which makes it unaffordable and inaccessible to many patients, especially in developing countries where a large number of people are poor and the concept of health insurance is at its nascent stage.\n \nBut the silver lining is that once the innovator company loses their intellectual property right and patent protection after a stipulated period, it opens the window of opportunities for companies evince an interest in manufacturing similar products, which cost less, and at that time, it is known as biosimilar or similar biologic.\n \nBiosimilar is a biologic product, which is very similar to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biological product known as reference product and has no clinically meaningful differences in term of safety and effectiveness from the reference product.\n \nBut similar biologics are not exactly identical to reference biologics because of the complex structure, which may be affected by minor alteration in sequences and post translational modification\nDegree of Complexity in Biologics\nUnlike generic medicines, manufactured through chemical synthesis, biologic medicines contain one or more active principles produced or derived from a biologic source, including a wide range of products like vaccines, allergens or recombinant proteins.\n\nMost biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies, have a highly complex molecular structure that is difficult to identify or characterize and they are manufactured using the most innovative technologies.\n \nIn biologics, monoclonal antibodies have relevance in the treatment of pathologies that affect a large number of people: cancer, lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis.\n \nBiosimilars are medicines manufactured through biotechnology and which have demonstrated their equivalence in quality, efficacy and safety to the reference product.\n \nWhat is the Opportunity for India?\nThe global biologics market size was valued at USD 276.6 billion in 2015. These products represent cutting-edge research and also enable the latest scientific discoveries. Such discoveries can be translated into novel therapies that provide new treatment options for patients.\n \nMoreover, an increased understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of disease has opened\nthe development of a range of targeted treatments. For instance, recombinant proteins aid the immune system in the identification and binding of foreign substances.\n\nFuture in Biologics \nBiologics are basically products that are produced from living organisms or contain components of living organisms. They include a wide variety of products derived from humans, animals or\nmicroorganisms using the tools of biotechnology.\nFollow-on biologics and biosimilars as a class of drugs have emerged as an effective alternative\nto reduce the cost of biologic therapies.\n \nAccording to a report by Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (Assocham), the global market for biologics will be $240 billion and the Indian market will be over $35 bn by 2030\nIndian pharma companies including Biocon, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Zydus Wellness\nare actively focusing on the biologics market.\n \nBiocon, for instance, earned Rs 1,517 crore or nearly 28% revenue from biologics in FY19- FY20.\nA lot will however depend upon factors such as access to cr gitical technology, regulatory guidelines and the price difference between biosimilars and the underlying biologics. For instance, the price gap between the two has significantly widened to over 60% for some drugs in Europe from just over 20% a few years ago. There is a pressing need for the biologic drugs in the global healthcare to address the unmet need in multiple therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, nephrology, immunology, diabetes and others.\n \nIndia is a leading player in the biologics market at global level. Domestic Indian companies such as: Biocon, Dr Reddy’s, Intas Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Pharma, and Lupin Pharmaceuticals are few of the key players with the largest number of products launched in the country as well as in other emerging economies.\nMoreover, with growing interest in biologics in the Indian landscape, many new companies,\nincluding startups such as Enzene Biosciences, are also jumping on the biologics bandwagon. \n                   SHUCHI.P.NAHAR \n\nFor more updates : @shuchi_nahar",

    "summary": "Emerging Trends in Animal Health Care Industry\n\nSHUCHI.P.NAHAR\n\nJust like the world around us, animal health has undergone transformational change in the 21st century. Animals are receiving better care, medicines are becoming more targeted, and diseases have even been eradicated. There's no sign that this change will stop soon. Here are the four trends that will drive animal agriculture and petcare in the coming years.The niche global animal health sector is witnessing exciting growth opportunities and consolidation. On the one hand, the opportunity landscape is driven by population expansion, increased demand for animal protein, changing lifestyles and evolving habits. On the other hand, the consolidation is the result of growing compliance and complexity.\n\nThe global animal health market size was valued at USD 47.1 billion in 2019 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period. The market is largely driven by a significant rise in demand for protein food and an increase in the incidence of zoonotic and food-borne diseases globally. This unprecedented rise in disease prevalence has triggered companies to produce advanced vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The high demand has also resulted in a subsequent increase in the number of companies undertaking consistent efforts to control pathogen contamination risks and food-borne diseases, which is contributing to the growth of the overall market for animal health.\n\n   \n                                                 \nThe market is driven by technological advancements in veterinary health care,\nand this is anticipated to offer future growth opportunities.These advancements include \nthe advent of efficient information  management systems, animal owner mobile technology, and vaccine banks.\nHigh focus on innovation in animal health has given rise to certain measures that are strengthening market growth prospects. \nFor instance, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private partnership to support collaborative research in order to boost innovation in veterinary pharmaceuticals in Europe.\nFor instance, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private partnership to support collaborative research in order to boost innovation in veterinary pharmaceuticals in Europe.\n\nAnimal Type Insights\n\nProduction animals dominated the market in 2019. The substantial share captured by the segment is a consequence of high concern for food safety and sustainability by government healthcare organizations globally. Policymakers in various countries are striving to achieve total food security, which propels large-scale food production and results in greater rearing of livestock.\n                                                  \n\n\nRegional Insights\nThe policies are focused on long-term sustainability, which can be achieved through a combination of improving productivity and greater attention to livestock veterinary healthcare. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in emerging economies, animal-based food products account for one-third of human protein consumption, leading to an increase in livestock productivity, which is critical to meet dietary needs of the growing human population. These factors cumulatively are responsible for the significant share captured by production animals in this segment.\n\nRecently, the $26 billion animal health market has moved beyond straight pharmaceuticals and vaccines, with investors pouring $156 million in pet tech startups alone, according to CB Insights. New venture funds are targeting feed nutrition and data technology as well.  \nSo what are the most exciting opportunities in a changing industry? Let’s look at three major growth sectors.\n \nLivestock Animals\n \nThe world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion people by 2050 (a staggering jump from today’s 7.6 billion). Meat production is expected to double by 2020 with the population growth, coupled with changes in dietary preference and rising income levels. \nThe pressure on farmers to feed more people, with less water and land available, in an environmentally sustainable fashion, will be extraordinary. Livestock production, while increasing, still faces barriers in infectious and parasitic diseases, especially in developing countries while public funding for disease control has been on the decline for decades.\nInnovation and biotechnology promise assistance with improved diagnostics and genomics applied to develop next-generation vaccines to prevent disease as well as the development of alternatives to antibiotics tackling disease resistance.\n\nThe trend toward antibiotic resistance poses a global threat to humans and animals. Alternative products — vaccines, prebiotics, probiotics and immune modulators, for instance — provide veterinarians and farmers with new options to reduce the use of antibiotics. Their areas of use target herd growth promotion, disease prevention and disease treatment. Major industry players like Tyson and Perdue have already responded to consumer demands for the reduction or elimination of antibiotic use in raising livestock.\n\nAnother focus area for livestock production is improving nutrition via feed quantity and quality. Efforts include microbial improvements to soil to make stronger plant nutrients, ways to reduce spoilage, employing microbes to improve animal digestive ability, new mineral and enzyme supplements, and applying gene editing technology to improve nutrient levels in plants.\nThe flip side of increasing livestock production is an approach to grow the next generation of meat-like proteins or build a market for alternative proteins. Today’s market has witnessed the growth of novel sources of protein, from baking flour made of crickets to the production of meat protein from cell-based cultures. Companies like Memphis Meats and Impossible Foods are earning passionate followings for their innovative approaches to a clean diet that’s friendly to both the palate and a sapped planet.\n\nFamily Animals\n\nThe livestock sector has no choice but to respond to urgent global demands. The pet segment, however, faces a different challenge: How to cater to pet owners who’ve started seeing their animals as family, and are desperate to help these family members live longer, healthier, more comfortable lives? \n \nIn the U.S. alone, 68 percent of households now include a pet, up from 58 percent in 1988. People lavish their pets with love and concern like they do other family members, with the total U.S. pet industry expenditures project to rise almost $6 billion in two years to more than $72 billion in 2018.\n\nConsumer-facing, natural pet products are a booming industry, with middle class owners shelling out the extra dollars to give their animals the same organic lifestyle — from holistic food to natural flea and tick repellents to toys made from non synthetic fibers — they afford themselves. See also the rise of pet insurance, advanced pet surgical procedures, digital devices and specialty pet services to understand how much money pet owners today are willing to spend on man’s best friend.\n\nAnimal Healthscape \n\nAnimal healthcare sector has witnessed a paradigm shift to improve the quality of drugs mainly in developed economies. A significant increase in animal production has led to improvement of food safety systems in order to safeguard human health. The rising prevalence of infectious and parasitic diseases is creating the next wave of innovation in managing animal health. \n\nModern medicine and technology are focused on improving animal health and livestock production. Increasing demand for poultry and milk products across the globe is, in turn, driving the demand for feed additives, vaccines and drugs. Growing urbanisation, changing lifestyle and increase in per capita income have encouraged pet ownership as well as increased willingness to pay for pet healthcare. These advancements and new technologies have strengthened awareness, making treatment more focused towards effective outcomes, thus fuelling the growth of animal health market.\n\n\nAt a 4.8% CAGR, the global animal healthcare market is poised to reach US$ 45 billion by 2025 because of changing government policies and rising awareness among the general population. The North American animal industry is expected to remain dominant over the forecast period due to high penetration of animal healthcare products with a CAGR of 3.6%. \nThis will be driven by an increase in the number of government strategies to promote healthcare policies and is expected to further fuel the growth of the market. Europe, the second largest animal healthcare market, is forecasted to expand at a 4.4% CAGR over the Management Discussion and Analysis period, due to high numbers of pet animals, disposable incomes, animal husbandry practices for meeting ever increasing demand for non-vegetarian food. \n \nAnimal healthcare markets in France and Italy account for onethird of the European market and is estimated to expand at 4% CAGR over the forecast period, owing to large population of farm and pet animals. High income of pet owners as well as availability of pet insurance augment pet healthcare practices across the country. Latin America account for 11.5% share in the global market during 2019 and it is expected to remain same till 2025 while growing at a CAGR of 5.5%. Asia Pacific animal healthcare market is expected to witness strong growth at a CAGR of over 6.3% between 2018-2025 due to changing economies along with rising prevalence of animal diseases in this region. \n \nThe Indian animal healthcare market is estimated at ` 70 billion in 2019 with livestock accounting for 55% of the total, poultry for 40% and companion animals for the remaining 5%. Animal health in India has undergone significant changes over the last few years because of the adoption of innovative technologies used for prevention and cure of farm and companion animals. The business approach among animal health companies have evolved from therapeutics to preventive and then from productivity.\n \nAnimal Type Takeaway\n \nAnimal type segments are categorized as Equine, Dogs, Sheep & Goats, Cats, and Poultry. Among which, dogs accounted for the largest share of the total market, has recorded USD 4.83 billion in 2016.  The demand for dog’s therapeutics is relatively greater than other companion animals and the trend is likely to continue over the future period. Thus, companies are increasingly developing novel therapeutics under this segment. \nFor instance, in May 2016, European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Merck’s Bravecto Spot-on solution to treat fleas and ticks in dogs. Later, in July 2016, the company also received U.S. FDA approval for this product under name Bravecto Topical.\n \nProduct Takeaway\nProduct segment is divided into Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals, Feed Additives, Diagnostics, and Others. Increasing research and development activities coupled with favorable government initiatives has helped the pharmaceuticals segment to be on the top spot. Drugs segment is categorized into Over the Counter (OTC) and Prescription. Whereas, the distribution channel segment is bifurcated into E-commerce, Retail, and Hospitals. The application segment is divided in terms of Clinics, Point-of-Care Facilities, and others.\n\nRegional Takeaway\nRegionally, North America accounted for the largest share, closely followed by Europe. Presence of a large number of established pharmaceutical companies that are consistently striving for extensive commercialization of their veterinary products is presumed to be a key factor responsible for growth in both regions. \nAsia Pacific region is projected to grow with the highest CAGR owing to the rise in adoption of companion animals coupled with the increasing disposable income.\n\n The Future is Coming\nFrom nearly the origin of our species, history tells us that caring for other living creatures is an innately human act. Innovative ways to protect, treat and tend to the animals means the field of animal health is now evolving to parallel advances in human care. For example, the One Health Initiative urges coequal collaboration between medical disciplines to link human and animal medicines.\nTake heed from the advancements all around us. The animal health industry finds itself in a state of major transition and chaos brings opportunity. And we humans continue to find new, innovative ways to live alongside the animals in our lives.\n\n                                                     SHUCHI.P.NAHAR\n\n\n\nFor more updates : @shuchi_nahar",

Let’s look at three major growth sectors.<br /></span>&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Livestock Animals<br /></span>&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion people by 2050 (a staggering jump from today’s 7.6 billion). Meat production is expected to double by 2020 with the population growth, coupled with changes in dietary preference and rising income levels.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The pressure on farmers to feed more people, with less water and land available, in an environmentally sustainable fashion, will be extraordinary. Livestock production, while increasing, still faces barriers in infectious and parasitic diseases, especially in developing countries while public funding for disease control has been on the decline for decades.<br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Innovation and biotechnology promise assistance with improved diagnostics and genomics applied to develop next-generation vaccines to prevent disease as well as the development of alternatives to antibiotics tackling disease resistance.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 15pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The trend toward antibiotic resistance poses a global threat to humans and animals. Alternative products — vaccines, prebiotics, probiotics and immune modulators, for instance — provide veterinarians and farmers with new options to reduce the use of antibiotics. Their areas of use target herd growth promotion, disease prevention and disease treatment. Major industry players like Tyson and Perdue have already responded to consumer demands for the reduction or elimination of antibiotic use in raising livestock.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 15pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Another focus area for livestock production is improving nutrition via feed quantity and quality. Efforts include microbial improvements to soil to make stronger plant nutrients, ways to reduce spoilage, employing microbes to improve animal digestive ability, new mineral and enzyme supplements, and applying gene editing technology to improve nutrient levels in plants.<br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The flip side of increasing livestock production is an approach to grow the next generation of meat-like proteins or build a market for alternative proteins. Today’s market has witnessed the growth of novel sources of protein, from baking flour made of crickets to the production of meat protein from cell-based cultures. Companies like Memphis Meats and Impossible Foods are earning passionate followings for their innovative approaches to a clean diet that’s friendly to both the palate and a sapped planet.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 15pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Family Animals</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 15pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The livestock sector has no choice but to respond to urgent global demands. The pet segment, however, faces a different challenge: How to cater to pet owners who’ve started seeing their animals as family, and are desperate to help these family members live longer, healthier, more comfortable lives?&nbsp;<br /></span>&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In the U.S. alone, 68 percent of households now include a pet, up from 58 percent in 1988.

    "summary": "CDMO's to be considered as the next stepping stone for Pharma Companies...\n\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nIn recent years, pharmaceutical outsourcing has grown in popularity amongst drug developers across the industry. Companies are increasingly outsourcing to contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) due to the benefits outside expertise can bring to their business.\nSo, what are the benefits and how are current CDMO market trends shaping?\n\nPharma CDMO's Trends\nThe pharmaceutical industry is expected to be worth $1.5 trillion by 2021. The key trends driving this level of demand for pharmaceutical products include the world’s aging population, rising healthcare standards in developing countries, and expensive breakthrough therapies. This rapid influx of demand means that companies are faced with higher R&D costs and a need to invest in new capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe demand for healthcare and innovative solutions is growing globally with chronic diseases on the rise. The global pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow from $1,228.45 billion in 2020 to $1,250.24 billion in 2021 at 1.8% CAGR.\n\nThe global pharmaceuticals market is projected to rise at a considerable pace driven by the increasing investments in product R&D. The efforts put in to develop efficient products will bode well for the growth of the overall market in the coming years.\n\n\nIncrease in Investment in R&D\n\n\nWhile R&D spending is increasing, innovator companies continue to be challenged by the declining rate of investments in R&D. In the pharmaceutical industry, a considerable proportion of drug candidates fail during the regulatory process. This increases the average cost to develop and secure marketing approval for a new drug. The declining returns are encouraging many drug developers to outsource large parts of their R&D activities, along with leveraging new technologies, to make drug discovery and development cost-efficient and faster.\n\n\nThe CDMO Market\n\n\nAs the industry continues to grow, the CDMO market is increasingly segmenting. The outsourcing sector primarily segments by type of services, such as API development and manufacturing or drug delivery, however segmenting by technologies is also an emerging trend. Thirdly, segmenting by location is a popular approach.\n\nCDMO activity predominantly occurs in Europe and the US. Although the main location, supplying to the European market from outside presents many hurdles, such as the need to retest imported products and the variations in packaging required due to the multiple languages spoken across the market. In contrast, the US market has a common language and regulatory landscape for 300 million citizens, which helps to reduce logistical issues. \n\nThere is scope for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), with over 325,000 M&A transactions occurring in the US since 1985, meaning that there is a large capacity for market penetration and market share. \n\nAlthough western markets are often favorable locations, emerging markets also attract the attention of CDMOs. For example, India is a prime location for the CDMO market as it has secured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a large volume of its drug products and is home to a highly-skilled workforce.\n\n\nA prevailing trend in the CDMO market climate is a preference for outsourcing to CDMOs that provide a full-service offering. This is because these CDMOs operate across multiple locations and markets, offering support throughout the entire drug development and manufacturing process and catering to varying regulatory requirements. Outsourcing to a single CDMO enables drug developers to reduce complexity and in some cases less time to market, as they are dealing with one team.\n\n “Capacity consolidators”, whereby CDMOs advance their services via acquisitions, are gaining momentum too.\n\nOpportunities to Reduce Costs\nThere is an opportunity for CDMOs to make a significant contribution to the cost basis of the industry, potentially reducing the overall industry cost of goods sold (COGs) by more than 10% (or about $34 billion) by utilizing best-in-class practices from the pharmaceutical industry and other industries. \nHowever, the changes and improvements that are required will not be easy or inexpensive. There are also regulatory risks involved that must be managed. Still, there are major benefits if more cost-effective medicines reach the market while continuing to allow the industry to make a fair return on investment.\nOpportunities for CDMOs\n\nThe global pharmaceutical CDMO market was valued at $160.12 billion in 2020 as compared to $148.5 billion in 2019. It is expected to reach $236.61 billion by 2026, registering 6.5% CAGR during 2020-26. \n·     The CDMO service sector has gained a specifically unique edge to address some of the challenges that drug developers are facing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has impacted multiple aspects of the pharma and biopharma industry, from drug development, clinical trials, supplies, manufacturing to supply chain\nlogistics.\n·    Opportunities for CDMOs Larger companies view CDMOs as vital partners and build strategic integrated long-term partnerships.\n·    CDMOs can receive co-investments from firms that finance specialized development and manufacturing facilities at strategic CDMOs. CDMOs using advanced technology and specialized expertise create a niche given the increasing number of complex and high potency compounds.\n·    They can capture projects at an early stage and profit from upselling opportunities.\n·    CDMOs engaging in continuous manufacturing benefit in the form of increased operational efficiency reduced costs and minimal wastages. Increased number of small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies with no manufacturing capacity responsible for an increasing share of new drug approvals\n\nTools for Pharmaceutical Companies and CDMOs - Both pharma companies and CDMOs must implement best-in-class practices from all industries to significantly increase productivity and efficiency to reduce industry costs. Some examples of tools being partially utilized in the industry are listed.\nLean Six Sigma - This process improvement methodology has been effective across many industries. Embracing and systematically embedding this process will focus on eliminating waste and reducing variability. It is estimated that 90% of the activities and 50% of the costs in a normal process are not needed. Lean Six Sigma provides all involved with a way to challenge and improve everything. Several effective components are key to the pharmaceutical industry.\nQuality by design (QbD) - This aligns development with manufacturing so that the process is designed and developed with long-term outcomes considered. This is key, as many current pharmaceutical manufacturing processes lack this focus and are inefficient for commercial manufacturing, and at this point has become difficult to impossible to change owing to regulatory risk.\nThe right first time (RFT)  - Doing things with an RFT mentality reduces costly rework and shortens overall cycle time.\nProcess/cycle time improvement - Process inefficiency and cycle time are major contributors to costs. Process improvements will drive productivity and increase process yields. Cycle time reduction will allow major reductions in inventory, including both unfinished and finished goods.\nTechnology - Utilization of cost-effective technology will also drive efficiency and productivity improvements, including Parametric control/release, 3D printing, Robotics, Artificial intelligence, Continuous flow processing, and Cellular manufacturing/factory in a box.\nContribution\nby small pharma/biotech to new drug development globally\n\n\nMerger & Acquisitions\nMergers and acquisitions help CMOs offer integrated bioprocessing services to their clients, which, in turn, makes CMOs/CROs an attractive and feasible option for the rapid product launch. In recent years, the biopharmaceutical industry has witnessed a significant number of consolidations. These consolidations were mainly aimed at business expansion and to stay competitive in the biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing and services market.\nAlthough the biopharmaceutical CMO and CRO industry itself is relatively developed, the inception of new bioprocessing tools, novel therapeutics, and the priority shifts in the bio/pharmaceutical industry about products have increased the pressure on the contract bio manufacturers. As a result, Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) are adopting different business models for addressing their clients’ and stakeholders’ needs in the best possible way.\nFurthermore, the integration of single-use systems in production facilities helps the CMO's to economically expand the manufacturing capacity. The single-use products offer fast turnaround and limit allied activities, such as cleaning and changeover validation. However, the contract negotiations between CMOs and customers are observed to be difficult owing to the regulatory landscape and complexity of service. Clients and CMOs are facing issues about the IP rights, warranty, and liabilities, prices, and timelines which increases the complexity of negotiations.\nCapacity Utilization - Consumer goods companies run at greater than 85% capacity utilization. The pharmaceutical industry runs at about 30%–35%. An aggressive understanding and focus on increasing capacity utilization will generate major efficiency and productivity improvements that will significantly reduce the product's the cost/unit of product.\nThe above examples are only a subset of the spectrum of opportunities for improvement across the industry. These are no longer vague concepts but rather well-recognized tools delivering for best-in-class companies whose value has been demonstrated both within pharma and across other industries. The benefits are difficult to comprehend or imagine and challenging to achieve, but at the same time are possible to realize and will be critical to the industry’s future.\nCDMOs offer long-term supply security and share the risks due to their robust financial structures. Sponsors also get access to advanced technologies and expertise like High Potent Manufacturing, Isolator technology for injectables, etc. which otherwise requires investment for separate containment areas. This helps the sponsor to focus on their core competencies. \nIn addition, CDMOs take care of an end-to-end supply chain that reduces a sponsor’s effort associated with the management of inventory and logistics. This in turn helps to eliminate penalties associated with rescheduling due to delays. CDMOs offering integrated services help reduce time to market by performing all steps under one roof. \nLink to Master Class on Global CDMO's: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/07/a-masterclass-on-global-custom.html\n\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

These consolidations were mainly aimed at business expansion and to stay competitive in the biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing and services market.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding: 0pt 0pt 8pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Although the biopharmaceutical CMO and CRO industry itself is relatively developed, the inception of new bioprocessing tools, novel therapeutics, and the priority shifts in the bio/pharmaceutical industry about products have increased the pressure on the contract bio manufacturers. As a result, Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) are adopting different business models for addressing their clients’ and stakeholders’ needs in the best possible way.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding: 0pt 0pt 8pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Furthermore, the integration of single-use systems in production facilities helps the CMO's to economically expand the manufacturing capacity. The single-use products offer fast turnaround and limit allied activities, such as cleaning and changeover validation. However, the contract negotiations between CMOs and customers are observed to be difficult owing to the regulatory landscape and complexity of service. Clients and CMOs are facing issues about the IP rights, warranty, and liabilities, prices, and timelines which increases the complexity of negotiations.</span></p><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Capacity Utilization - </span><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Consumer goods companies run at greater than 85% capacity utilization. The pharmaceutical industry runs at about 30%–35%. An aggressive understanding and focus on increasing capacity utilization will generate major efficiency and productivity improvements that will significantly reduce the product's the cost/unit of product.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The above examples are only a subset of the spectrum of opportunities for improvement across the industry. These are no longer vague concepts but rather well-recognized tools delivering for best-in-class companies whose value has been demonstrated both within pharma and across other industries. The benefits are difficult to comprehend or imagine and challenging to achieve, but at the same time are possible to realize and will be critical to the industry’s future.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">CDMOs offer long-term supply security and share the risks due to their robust financial structures. Sponsors also get access to advanced technologies and expertise like High Potent Manufacturing, Isolator technology for injectables, etc. which otherwise requires investment for separate containment areas. This helps the sponsor to focus on their core competencies. </span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In addition, CDMOs take care of an end-to-end supply chain that reduces a sponsor’s effort associated with the management of inventory and logistics. This in turn helps to eliminate penalties associated with rescheduling due to delays. CDMOs offering integrated services help reduce time to market by performing all steps under one roof</span><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">. </span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"color: black;\"><b>Link to Master Class on Global CDMO's:</b> </span><a href=\"https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/07/a-masterclass-on-global-custom.html\">https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/07/a-masterclass-on-global-custom.html</a></span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 15pt; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><div style=\"color: black; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; white-space: normal;\"><b style=\"font-family: Georgia, Utopia, &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, Palatino, serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; text-indent: -24px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">Twitter Handle: <span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; color: #2b00fe; outline: 0px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shuchi_nahar?lang=en\" style=\"background: transparent; color: #37afc0; outline: 0px; text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">@shuchi_nahar</a></span></span></b></div><div style=\"color: black; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; white-space: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-indent: -18pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Disclaimer: The information provided on </span><a href=\"https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/\" style=\"background: transparent; color: #3b3b3b; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 15px; text-decoration-line: none; text-indent: -18pt;\"><span face=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #1155cc; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-indent: -18pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Pros and Cons of Index Investing -  By Late Mr. Parag Parikh\nShuchi.P.Nahar\nIndex funds\nare simply mutual funds that attempt to mimic a given market. There are actually many\nmore than that tracking many different markets of all shapes and sizes, but\neach one shares the same basic principle: Its goal is simply to match that\nparticular market’s return.\nIndex\ninvesting is therefore simply the process of using index funds to build a\npassive investment strategy. Index investors decide which markets they want to\ninvest in, how much of their money to put in each one, and utilize index funds\nto put that plan in place. \nWhat is market?\nWhere do you see the market going? how is market judged? By what the index is judged?\n\nThese\nare some of the basic questions that every investor asks sooner or later in his\ninvestment journey.\n If the index is up that means that the market\nis up, sometimes you may find the market is going up but your portfolio has\nnot increased or decreased.\nThis was very\nevident during the tech boom in 1999-2000 where the technology stocks formed\nabout 24% of the total index.\nIf you did not\npossess technology stocks and if the index was going up everyone was\nrejoicing around you they will think you are not never better off.\nin fact every\nmultinational fast moving consumer good company with strong brands, if you had\nthem if you had good engineering companies like L & T anything\nand you had a convention very good portfolio but during those times you were\nalways sad because while when the market is growing up but your stocks are\nstill the same but if you open the papers every day and they would say well the\nindex is up so much the markets are up so everyone is rejoicing but only a few\npeople were rejoicing now we have always talked about certain behavioral tendencies in the market.\n One of them is fancies of the market over a\nperiod of time what happens is different stocks , different sectors they become\nfancies in the market and when they become fancies in the market people only\nfollow them because our system is all designed in such a way that you only look\nat that sector which is a fancy.\nHowever,\nwhenever you are talking about a fancy of a sector what is a fancy everyone likes,\nit is something everyone chases it. If the stock price starts going up so it\nbecomes a fancy why does everyone talk about it because the newspapers only\nreport whereas there has been an abnormal profit or a loss in the company.\n So during times of fancies in a sector like we\nhad in the technology boom 2006- 2007 we had the infrastructure boom, the\nreal-estate boom then we had the power boom, now that time all those sectors\nwere fancy and during that time if you bought any power stocks till date you would\nbe losing. \nSimilarly is\nthe case with technology stocks also that if you bought in forces in 1999- 2000\nanything you are still not very well-off in fact you could be also losing so\nsometimes when you are chasing a fancy you end up paying a fancy price and when\nthat fancy ends what happens is the losses start coming in your pockets.\nSo markets are\nnormally made up of a musical chair game and one point of time there is\nsomething which is going up then second time something else comes up and the\nreal stocks , the real performers which have got steady income, steady\nprofits they never become fancy in the market they always perform properly.\nNow what\nare the stock markets anomaly? \nEvery company\nwould have its Growth phase, the maturity phase and eventually it will die, the\nmarkets are made in such a way that what has to be discarded gets discarded and\nthe new things come because that is rule of the markets. \nEverything is\nbased upon about continuity, however the companies which are listed in the\nmarkets are about discontinuity because they go through their different\nbusiness cycles and that's what happens in a market. \nWhen you have\nan index companies which are in the limelight, companies which are doing well\nultimately come and replace the companies which have become Laggard' so index\nwas made with an idea to capture what the market is and how could they capture\nwhat the market is only by looking at the size of the markets.\nNow what does creative\ndisruption means - to facilitate continuity by aiding with discontinuity of\nthe individual corporations so in that consists of a basket of the largest stocks\nbased on market capitalization. \nNow this index\nis based of the large market cap it is supposed to be representative of the\nmarkets however what is in reality happening is when you are about 7,000 stocks\nlisted on the Bombay Stock Exchange the high market cap stocks which capture\nthe index the only 30 of them similarly is the case with NSE where the sample\nsize is only 50 stocks where they are more than about 3,000 stocks listed.\nNow we are\ngoing to look at the markets taking into consideration only the market cap if is\nit the right way, are we really looking at the markets as it is said to be creative\ndisruption is in individual stocks ultimately they are thrown out of the\nmarkets creative and new stocks new ideas, new sectors they start coming into\nthe markets.\n Let’s take an example there was a time\nwhere we had the textile industry, today you're doing exceedingly well in the\n70s textile today define any textile representative but this is what creative disruption  is that at that point of time there was no\ntechnology stocks so the markets as times change as things are changing you\nhave new sectors coming, some sectors moving out and vice e versa  so that's what this called creative disruption\nHow does\none stock get into the index first case what is the listing history how long it\nhas been listed in the market? \n\n\n\n\nSecondly is\ntrading history today that how long people have been trading in that stock? How\nmuch is the volumes in that stock? \nFiscal results\nalso do the same do play their part but there are times like you had with the case\nof Reliance power that it was a big market capitalization although it was not a\nprofit-making company it got into the index in the same NSE the Nifty Index also\nwe had two companies one was Reliance Petroleum which was not a profit-making\nand another was keinz. I think both of them because they were big that is why\nthey got into the markets that's why for some of these management's it is\nimportant that they come out with big and big issues because we'll see what\nhappens once the stocks get into the indices so now if you had all these things.\nAn effective\nmeasure for us to judge the market by asking index key data index project up or\ndown I think just because there is some falsehood which is flowing and when everyone\nis talking about that falsehood then I think it becomes a truth and that's why\neach one of us as the same question newspapers also report the same question\nbut if you really try to understand the basics of in the index then we come\nto a realization well going there is no need to ask where the market is going\nbecause if you are running certain stocks your job is to see whether your stocks\nare doing well or not, not what the market is going because there may not be\nany relation with that.\nValue\ninvesting is all about buy something which is reasonable, which is valuable and\nthose are low P/E Stocks. \nSo, if it’s an\nactive investing in this form then how can a passive investing be really good? \nNow let's look\nat some of the behavioral anomalies of the participants of the markets because\nfor some things which happen in the market is because of a whole lot of anomaly\nis not only of the investors but it is also of the companies of the regulators\nof the operators of the management let's see them one by one.\n1)The\nmystery of the Unknown\nSo most of us\nare always willing to pay something higher for something which is unknown for a\nmystery and when the mystery get some reveal the charm of the newness goes away\nand then the reality comes in this was very evident how did the tech boom start\nwhere it was coming from everyone  that the\ncomputers will lead to change and you will have to do certain things about the\nworld will come to an end.\nWhat will happen\nwhen everything was on computers and that's how the tech boom started because nobody understood\nwhat it is, so then you have so many companies coming in the technology boom\nstarted and then ultimately with the internet and the dot-com boom in it. \nSo everything goes in mystery for people that's why we paid exorbitant prices even\na company small company like AOL they say it took over Time Warner Brothers so\nall craziest things started using because the value of the unknown is a mystery.\nSo unknown that everyone was excited by it so there is one thing certain that\nwould happen it's like in the markets Buy when everyone is panicky and sell\nwhen everyone is interested.\n2)\nManagement Greed \nThe management\nof a company would always like the company to come into an index and management\nreally understands that it is the market cap that gets you in. Then they have\noperators in the market, who can really run the stock prices.\nI think those\ncompanies whose market cap becomes big and that market caps ultimately helps\nthem to come so whoever wins out of management also they playing a very big\nrole in getting the stocks into the index because once your stock is in the index\nthere are many benefits not only it becomes a fancy for everyone,  not only most of the mutual funds and all they\ninvest into it but the management gains a lot of credibility the stock is an\nindex talk secondly, bankers and all they think they also lent against those\nstocks so there were lot of other benefits which come in which increases the\nmanagement greed also if the market cap increases their own wealth also\nincreases so it becomes very easier for them to this thing you have this give\nstock options and all those things so then they can attract better talent there\nare a lot of other issues also.\n3)\nOperators\nHow do they go\nto derivative operators because operators would love to rig up a stock\nespecially if it is going to get into the index it becomes easier so you have a\nnew breed of operators who are looking at rigging that this high market cap stocks?\n4) Herd\nMentality\nHerd mentality\nwe've always been talking about it that as more and more people try to get\ninto index talks when everyone is going, though it starts going with them so\nit's like a Pied Piper whatever he starts doing and then people start following.\n\nWhen everyone starts\nchasing and then you have a herd to follow that stock then that person again\nbecomes a salesman for that stock of course the operators and the herd mentality\nthey are one thing which go hand in hand together.\nQuest: Why do\ninvestors go for index investing?\nIndex investing\nis just a heuristic in the mind it's a mental shortcut the brain takes in\nprocessing information.\n It is more processing all the information that's\nwhere you are taking shortcuts and that shortcuts are known as heuristics.\nThe herd\nmentality it's again everyone is buying so we want to go with it so you have a\nbig following coming in the mutual funds also if it is in the portfolio of 10\nbig mutual funds the small ones also would start going behind that.\nThen comes no management\nfees it is again a big trigger every day saying “I am saving that means my\nreturns will increase”. Secondly there is no regret aversion, if you have\nbought an index stocks, if it goes down you would say the luxury of thinking\nthat its fine if index has gone down everyone else is also losing, if it went\nup everyone else is winning. So here comes the comfort of not losing alone.\nEmployee\nworking won’t have to be worried about what the boss will say because he has\nbought an index stock. They have all gone down so everyone was doing index\ninvesting and now everyone is at the par level with you there cannot be any relative better performance\nof bad performance. \nSecondly, they're advertised very heavily and it creates an\navailability bias for them because everyone is having deep pockets will always advertise\ntheir funds talking about no management fees and that is what is liked by\npeople.\nIndex\nInvesting Is Low-Cost\nOne of the\nbiggest reasons that index investing is so effective is also one of the\nsimplest: It’s low-cost. Cost is actually the single best predictor of a mutual\nfund’s future performance. Better than past returns. Better than the fund\nmanager’s track record. Low costs lead to better returns.\nIndex funds\nare often the lowest-cost investments available simply because they don’t\nrequire a portfolio manager who needs to be paid. And they also don’t incur all\nthe trading costs, taxes, and other expenses that go into some of the more\nactive strategies. \nIndex funds\nhave a simple job: track the market. That simplicity keeps costs low, and those\nlow costs are passed on to you in the form of higher returns.\n\nThere\nhave been studies both in favor and against active management. Many managers\nperform worse than their comparative benchmarks, but that does not change the\nfact that there are exceptional managers who regularly outperform the market.\nIndex investing has merit if you want to take a broad economic view, but there\nare many reasons why it's not always the best route to achieving your personal\ninvesting goals.\n\n\n                             SHUCHI.P.NAHAR\n\nFor more updates : @shuchi_nahar",

Low costs lead to better returns.<o:p></o:p></font></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: justify;\"><font face=\"georgia\">Index funds\nare often the lowest-cost investments available simply because they don’t\nrequire a portfolio manager who needs to be paid.

Cost saving and time saving\nbenefits associated with the implementation of outsourcing is responsible for\ndriving the industrial growth. \nCompanies\nare investing in infrastructure, personnel, and technology in order to gain\nsignificant share of the outsourcing revenue. Increasing demand as a\nconsequence of ongoing patent cliff of the biologic drugs is expected to fuel\ndemand. \nPresence\nof end-to-end service providers that are engaged in providing value added\nservices for an integrated or risk sharing business model is expected to\nbolster progress in this industry. Moreover, new product launches and novel\ndrug delivery mechanisms are anticipated to drive outsourcing demand.\nThe industry has been alternating between the\ncycles of inadequate and excessive production capacity for contract as well as\ncaptive manufacturers. Hence, it is important for Contract Manufacturing\nOrganizations (CMOs) to make cautious decisions pertaining to capacity\nexpansion and choice of deals.\nCDMO\nGlobal Market\nThe\nCDMO market is estimated to grow to $157.7 billion in 2025, a compound annual\ngrowth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% since 2018, outpacing the pharmaceutical industry as\na whole.\nEven\nfor the biggest pharma companies, CDMOs have graduated from supply\nchain to more ratified value chain partners – no\nminor attitudinal adjustment.\nFierce\ncompetition, cost pressure, constant technological innovations and increasing\nconsolidation activities raise the question of which steps [CDMOs] can take to\nsecure or expand their position in this contested market.\n“Should\nthey focus on their core business or broaden their range of services? Should\nthey follow the market trend and consolidate or try to grow organically?”\nWhich\nof these options would most benefit Outsourced Pharma readers?\n\n\nCDMO is in a growth phase.\nAdditional manufacturing capacity\nAvoiding redundant manufacturing capacity(Capex avoidance before commercial launch)\nOpex reduction/avoidance is another driver\nMitigate the risk of supply shortage\nReduce time to market ( If internal capacities are limited)\nFavorable macros (increasing population, insurance coverage,ageing societies,rare disease)\nSmall and virtual biotech need manufacturing infrastructure\n\n\n\nWidespread\nGrowth\nHere’s\na look at that estimated 6.9% CAGR growth by service sector.\n\n\n\n\nYou\ncan see consistent growth across the board. Next here’s a look at where it’s\ntaking place. \n\n\nAsia Pacific region is leading\nChina,India are top  in API/CDMO\nUS/EU have advanced ecosystem\nAsia has lower Capex and Opex relative to US/EU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\ncan generally characterize by great fragmentation despite the strong merger and\nacquisition activities in recent years. And it’s not only CDMOs acquiring their\ncompetitors.\n“Large\nlife sciences companies and private equity firms were responsible for some of\nthe largest deals in the sector (e.g., in 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific paid\n18.2 times Patheon’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (EBITDA) to acquire the leading CDMO.”\nNonetheless,\nthe precipice of 2020, the CDMO market remained “highly fragmented, with more\nthan 75% of participants having revenues below $50 million, and the five\nleading CDMOs holding only 15% of the total market share.”\nWhich\ncan only mean one thing: More changes are coming to a CDMO near you.\nCDMO Business Model\n\n\n\n\nThe\nsegmentation of the pharmaceutical CDMO value chain follows three major\ncategories:\nDrug And Process Development,\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient (Api) Production And\nFinished Dosage Form (FdF). \n\n\nClose\nto these CDMO core segments are drug discovery and development support,\nprovided by contract research organizations (CROs) as well as contract\npackaging services, which are provided by CDMOs or specialized contract\npackaging organizations (CPOs).\nTasks\noutsourced to CDMOs by pharmaceutical companies cover the entire value chain of\na drug’s life cycle, from drug development and preclinical and clinical trials\nto commercial production. While traditional CMO services were cantered on their\ncore competencies in API bulk manufacturing and formulation, CDMOs have also\nmoved into adjacent segments along the manufacturing value chain. \n\n\nSpeciality CDMO have a domain technology focus.\nCapacity consolidators prefer inorganic growth\nVertical Integratators offer a broad range of services from lab to commercial scale manufacturing\n\n\nThese tasks,\nwhich in the past have been covered by pharmaceutical companies themselves or\nby contract research organizations, include medical chemistry, support for\npreclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, and formulation and process analytics\ndevelopment.\nCDMO\nFragmentation\n\n\n\nSource: IIC Presentation\nAs CDMO\nindustry is relatively immature and fragmented there lies more growth\nopportunity.\nMajority\nplayers are very small. There is absence of overall market leadership. CDMO is\na contract related service business which is sticky with long term customer\nrelations. Many smaller CDMOs are either private entities or part of PE\nportfolios. \nHere\nare the key pointers that proves the industry as fragmented.\n\n       Highly regulated industry\n       High barriers to entry\n       High switching cost\n       Highly competitive industry\n       Majority are privately held \n       Challenging for small companies to\nsustain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacing\nGrowth Imperatives\nWith some\nexceptions, today Big Pharma tends to want fewer, more integrated partners, and\nso that is a path to survival for many CDMOs.\nThe branches in the decision-making tree for those CDMOs are:\nvertical or horizontal integration, and acquisition or organic growth.\n\n\n\n\nVertical\nIntegration\nCDMOs\ncan strengthen core areas and establish themselves by extending their service\nportfolio. In general, this kind of expansion “is less costly\nand involves lower initial risks than horizontal integration, because the CDMO\ncan build on existing knowledge. It also fulfils most regulatory requirements\nand enables cross-selling to existing customers.”\nWith\n25% of APIs under development highly potent and trending up, offering HP\nservices is a logical step for many CDMOs, although building HP facilities can\nbe a costly investment.\nThe\nstudy also predicts the pharmaceutical-packaging outsourcing market will grow\nat 7.3%, due to new and more rigorous packaging and handling requirements. New\ntechnologies – think “smart packaging – allow for improved functionality and\nhelp a CDMO stand out from the competition.\n\n\nVertical integration generally seen more straightforward\nCustomer gets to consolidate sourcing\n\n\n\nHorizontal\nIntegration\nCDMOs\nthat want to diversify their risk or position themselves as fully integrated\nservice providers can start offering services for other dosage forms, expanding\ninto a new dosage form tends to be an expensive and risky endeavour. Barriers\nto entry include high upfront costs, lack of expertise and reputation, and\nfinding qualified employees.\nInterestingly,\nthe sterile liquids are the fastest-growing dosage form in the CDMO\nmarket. Profit margins are highest in this segment, making it an attractive\ndosage form for new market entrants.\nSolid\ndosage forms are becoming less attractive (compared to liquid forms), but\n“remain a profitable and growing segment,” as this remains the most common\ndosage form for newly approved drugs.\nAcquisition\nor Organic Growth\n “Considerations about whether organic growth\nor acquisition is the more suitable method of expansion should be factored in right from the beginning, as they are\nclosely intertwined with the feasibility of different strategic options [facing\nCDMOs].”\nAcquisitions\nallow CDMOs to expand relatively quickly. They add new technologies to\nportfolios and access to new customers, again opening opportunities for cross\nselling. Some CDMOs are also looking to gain a more global footprint through a\nmerger.\nThe\ncaveat: Only ~50% of mergers across all industries succeed, “and the choice of acquisition or organic growth is strongly linked to\nthe financial means of the CDMO.”\nCDMO Opportunities and Risk\nOpportunities\n\n\nIncreasing pharmaceutical specialty chemicals research, developments and manufacturing outsourcing (Capex, opex avoidance , risk mitigation)\nIncreasing number of virtual,small biotech and small to mid pharma with inadequate development,scale up infrastructure\nTechnological advancement\nNew operational techniques\nHelp big pharma transform fixed costs to variable\nFaster research at lower cost\n\n  Risk\n\nZero tolerance culture for clients IP protection\nBreach of data protection (Regulatory Compliance)\nEver evolving and fragmented regulatory environment\nCompetitive marketplace unless CDMO has some unique advantage\nHigh dependence on skilled labour \nSupply chain disruptions\nCustomer concentration \nInnovator pausing or suspending development \nTermination of relationship\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nCDMOs\nthat want to succeed need to consider their reaction to current trend and\nevaluate their strategic options.Capabilities company size, ownership, risk preference,\norganizational culture and available capital are just some of the factors that\nmust be taken into account. \nCDMOs face excellent growth opportunities in a\npharmaceutical market environment where using outsourcing service is becoming\nnew norm.\nCritical Success Factors\n\n\nRespect for innovator's intellectual property \nImmaculate regulatory compliance track record\nSuperior technology investments\nAgility and supply chain reliability\nR&D,documentation,data integrity and manufacturing excellence\nClient Centric mindset\nAdequate human capital investments(Skill & Capacity)\nAdequate research,development and manufacturing infrastructure\n\n\nDisclaimer: So in this article I have tried to summarized the learning from one of the webinar held by Indian investing Conclave. \nInsights by: Sajal Kapoor \nModerated by: Jatin Khemani \nI have also cumilated all the learnings from various publicly available documents on CDMO.

    "summary": "Investing Journey Over the Past 2-3 Years..\nShuchi. P. Nahar\n\n\nLife is all about learning. Sometimes we fail and sometimes we succeed but when it comes to investing why people take it otherwise. Staying in the industry for just 2-3 years I have learnt a lot and here I would like to share my learning with you all. \nDon't consider investing or markets otherwise, it is part of your life and its not your whole life. Success and failures are irresistible. Learning from them is the biggest key for a happy and wonderful life. Hope this article will be a value addition. \n\n\n 11 Important Lessons that I Learnt from my 2-3 years of Experience in this Roller-coaster Ride, \nThat's Just Begun....\n  \n1) Be Observant\n\n\nSo when I began my investing journey , markets & investing were all new to me, having the best opportunity and best mentor around me , I couldn't let any of those moments be wasted. \nHaving a desire to learn every second is the only thing that will always keep us on our toes and will never let us take things for granted. This key helped me to gain maximum and learning every second was the biggest takeaway.\n\n\nBeing extra attentive then others will not bring any problem, rather it will help you imbibe all the qualities that you see around. \nMentors will guide us, they will show us the right path and way to reach , but in the end it's upon us how we ride the journey. \n\n\n2) Great Losses are Great Lessons \n\n\nWhen I entered the markets in early January 2018 markets somewhere just started to fall and looking around me I observed that someone were confused about buying options or someone was struggling about their current portfolios. \n\n\nI realized one thing: Never marry your stocks. It was the falling market which made me think (Gladdd!!!! I wasn't invested) \n\n\nLooking at all of it I understood one thing , that take risk as per your appetite not looking at what others do. It's not important to always to learn from our own mistakes, sometimes taking advantage of others' mistakes will save our money and time.\n\n\nOne incident that i can relate with : one of my colleague got heavily invested in one of his diligently researched stock. He concentrated his entire portfolio in that one stock and when markets started crashing down, he went upset. \n\n\nLooking at him I realized one thing that never put all your eggs in one basket and secondly if things don't go according to your research in one year of your purchase start moving out. \n\n\n3) Documenting Every Stuff\n\n\nThis was one the best lessons I learnt by attending one of the courses of Neeraj Sir. He urged everyone to write and prepare journals and by listening to him I felt there is nothing wrong to have proof of everything. It's one of the best habits that I cultivated.\n\n\nIt's not just a proof but it's a journey that will keep on improvising throughout your life. Sometimes you may forget your mistakes but your journal won't let you repeat it again. I started documenting from that same day Neeraj Sir said and today after two years of that I have each and every small/ big mistakes or an achievement written. Everything has been recorded. I call that journal or diary a Hall of mistakes.\n\n\n4) Appreciate Yourself\n\n\nNever compare yourself with what others do, or what they have achieved. I learnt this when I started my journey, that everyone around us is going to be better in something or the other, where we cannot reach. So it's better to concentrate on what abilities we are born with rather than wasting time and cribbing over other's success. \n\n\nI learnt this in markets, whatever is written in your destiny sooner or later it will happen. Doesn't matter if my researched stock is bought by someone at a lower rate and I couldn't step into it.. It's fine! It's absolutely fine if you cannot, wait may be some bigger opportunity waiting. Just never let your morale and enthusiasm come down. They are the key for us to stay motivated. \n\n\n5) Be Frugal\n\n\nDon't spend money for something unnecessary, or else one day you have to sell your  necessary stuff for money. It's not about not enjoying or not doing something that we love, it's about knowing when to spend and how much to spend. \n\n\nWhen I started living far from my hometown for my job I realized life is not that easy what I imagined. Staying alone teaches a lot. We all will agree but I learnt the greatest lesson and that was to spend every penny so carefully that you don't regret ever. Now when it comes to investing just don't spend your hard earned cash on something you are not sure about, there will be a lot of noises around we have to filter the best one. \n\n\n6) Stay Away from Biases\n\n\nBiases will never let you grow in the real world as well as in investing. Sometimes we all become the victims of one of the biases. Be that a recency bias, researched stock bias, conservatism bias or closed mind bias. Something or the other once in a lifetime everyone of us would have faced. \n\n\nAvoiding such biases will help us avoid many mistakes and surely will help us to make confident decisions. When we fall into the trap of any such bias we don't know where we go wrong and the second wrong thing we do is blame others. Blame game won't stop ever, and success begins when we ourselves take charge of our mistakes. \n\n\nDo your own homework, and write your own exam. In the end you and your luck should be the reason for every decision. \n\n\nJust to add an real life my experience: I had one company that I studied for approximately 3-4 months and made a report and did all the due diligence required and after few days someone very close to me gave a negative perspective about it, for which I wasn't prepared. I got bamboozled now what ? Itni mehnat ki and ab all in vain but then too new to markets have that research bias wala keeda - kar diya invest.. \nSo here came my researched stock bias and unfortunately I made my dad invest in it. So just one crip takeaway keep both the perspective in mind and people who are pessimistic will always help you find the flaws nicely. \n\n\n7) Be Fearless\n\n\nWhy to fear losses or failures? We all are learners here !\n\n\nI learnt this from my mentor Chetan sir. Initially when I began my journey I feared what if I don't do things properly, what if Iose money, what if people will judge me that my thesis went wrong. \n\n\nHe just said one thing: we all are learners, no one is perfect and no one is supposed to be perfect. We all evolve, we should learn from our mistakes and just keep moving. \n\n\nWe should not be afraid of trying new things, or we should not be afraid of things that don't go in the same manner we planned. We are riding a rollercoaster, just enjoy it!\nBreathtaking moments will surely come but in the end you'll definitely smile. \n\n\nHigher the risk, higher the returns. We should not worry about returns just give a best shot while taking risk, and return will take care of itself. \n\n\n8) Stay Dedicated\n\n\nDedication is the most important thing that can change anyone's life. If you are dedicated to something , nothing can stop you to excel in it. I started at the age of 18 and heard many people around me saying that she is just a kid. Thinking about what I would be knowing at that age and stepping my foot in one of the complex sectors(Pharma)as all says. \n\n\nAfter two years I realized one thing if you are dedicated to something there is nothing that can stop you. If you are dedicated you don't need any motivation to get up everyday for office or you won't need any vacation either. Doing what you love will always keep you dedicated. Never let anyones opinion change your decision. It's you in the end, who matters the most. \n\n\n9) Keep Learning \n\n\nOur minds are like parachutes, it should be open everytime or we will die due to narrow mindness. \nWe all are students, no one is an expert. Some will have more experience and some with less experience. But there is always room for improvement. Never ever consider yourself superior to others, that will be the stage when you will be deteriorating. \n\n\nNo matter how well known or rich you are, it's just a phase of your life. Never take that too seriously! Once it's gone it will be gone forever. What will stay with us forever is our learnings and our politeness. Be humble, be kind and keep learning. \nThere are a lot of amazing things that we can never reach in this lifetime, so never stop learning. \n\n\n10) Stay Jolly \n\n\nAbove all this is THE MOST IMPORTANT lesson that I learnt. Stay jolly -Staying happy is the only way we can achieve whatever we want in life. If we are not happy by what we don't we cannot go the long way. Work is a part of life, it's not life. Spending time with family, friends and most importantly with yourself is the best way to stay happy and enjoy every moment of life. \n\n\nThanks to this covid-19 which helped binding families together, knowing what was more important. People who owned Mercedes were also at home and people owning a rickshaw were also at home. \n\n\nDoesn't matter how much you earn or how much the world recognizes you, in the end you should be able to bring smiles to your near and dear ones that's the real wealth. \nSmiles don't come only through spending money, it comes by spending our valuable time with our dear ones. \n\n\n11) Staying Positive\n\n\nThere will be lots of moments when things will not pan out the way we imagined. Some days will be there when all the hard work goes in vain. That's not the time to mourn or be negative about yourself , it's time to learn from those failures and prepare yourself for the next move. \n\n\nThought process evolution after this 2020 market fall…\n\n\nThis market crash taught me to be more confident in myself. Where everything was falling and people were panicky “ab kya le” “sab toh ghir raha hei” “aur kitna niche jaayega”. \nI learnt one thing never deviate yourself due to the market noises, time kharab tha , company thodi kharab hai. Just stick to your thesis , go and read history. \n\n\nSit back and relax and continue with your reading and learnings. Don't go in herds just because someone close to you is going. It's fine if we don't follow the crowd . \nWhat we need to do at that time is just to make your thesis strong, grab opportunities by having strong conviction from inside, not the distraction from outside. \n\n\nDoesn't matter how many times we fail, go wrong , or get criticized, if we are confident in ourselves , things will definitely go our way. \n\n\nEverything happens for something good. If you cry over things that you don't have , you will never appreciate what you have been working so hard. If you are here , reading this today - you are alive ,you can do wonders  if you want to , you are blessed. \n\n\nAppreciate that blessing. So lastly I would thank everyone who was directly or indirectly part of this learning journey. \n\n\nStay happy ! Stay positive ! Keep reading..\n\n\n                     SHUCHI. P.

Spending time with family, friends and most importantly with yourself is the best way to stay happy and enjoy every moment of life.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks to this covid-19 which helped binding families together, knowing what was more important. People who owned Mercedes were also at home and people owning a rickshaw were also at home.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doesn't matter how much you earn or how much the world recognizes you, in the end you should be able to bring smiles to your near and dear ones that's the real wealth.&nbsp;</div><div>Smiles don't come only through spending money, it comes by spending our valuable time with our dear ones.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>11) Staying Positive</b></div><div><br /></div><div>There will be lots of moments when things will not pan out the way we imagined. Some days will be there when all the hard work goes in vain. That's not the time to mourn or be negative about yourself , it's time to learn from those failures and prepare yourself for the next move.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Thought process evolution after this 2020 market fall…</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>This market crash taught me to be more confident in myself. Where everything was falling and people were panicky <i>“ab kya le” “sab toh ghir raha hei” </i>“aur kitna niche jaayega”.&nbsp;</div><div>I learnt one thing never deviate yourself due to the market noises, time kharab tha , company thodi kharab hai. Just stick to your thesis , go and read history.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Sit back and relax and continue with your reading and learnings. Don't go in herds just because someone close to you is going. It's fine if we don't follow the crowd .&nbsp;</div><div>What we need to do at that time is just to make your thesis strong, grab opportunities by having strong conviction from inside, not the distraction from outside.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doesn't matter how many times we fail, go wrong , or get criticized, if we are confident in ourselves , things will definitely go our way.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Everything happens for something good. If you cry over things that you don't have , you will never appreciate what you have been working so hard. If you are here , reading this today - you are alive ,you can do wonders  if you want to , you are blessed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Appreciate that blessing. So lastly I would thank everyone who was directly or indirectly part of this learning journey.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Stay happy ! Stay positive ! Keep reading..</div><div><br /></div><div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SHUCHI. P.

    "summary": "Post Pandemic Views & Investment Journey - Mohnish Pabrai\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nShuchi.P.Nahar\nIntroduction:\nRadhika Gupta, CEO of Edelweiss Asset Management, and Mohnish Pabrai discuss bridge, Dhandho investing, Mohnish’s lunch with Warren Buffett, the importance of patience in investing, and the current investment landscape.\nQuest by Radhika Gupta: In order to start this conversation with a quote that she has heard from mohnish pabrai and this is something very close to her, you said that the good news in investing is there are no HR problems because if there are no humans there are no problems. So if we want to know why Mohnish Pabrai chose to invest as a career because he actually started out in sales and marketing and then he did entrepreneurship and then turned investor so how his professional journey took a turn?\nAnswer by Mohnish Pabrai: So most of us when we grow up we basically tend to confirm what the world expects of us or how the world expects us to act or behave or things to do and so on so forth. \nSo each of us as humans has a some has a kind of let's say core map of who we are on the inside and then there is how we act on the outside and the problem with the map that we have,on the inside of who we are the theory is that it's hard-coded at the age of five between your genetics and first five years of life experience and after that it's not going to change for the rest of your life.\nSo it's pretty much set in stone the problem is that most of us do not know ourselves well enough to know what that inner map is,so we go through life and that would be called as misaligned.\nSo for example, if you have this as your inner map and this is your outer map this is typical in almost most humans there's the misalignment and if you can get to inner and outer aligning really well which happens in a lesser of humans you can go really far in life because then you're maximizing all.\nYou know capabilities and you know preferences and what you love to do and so on. \nIn 1999 so when he was 34 years old and that's when he actually got a document which gave him his inner map and a lot of things that he had been doing until then were not in sync.\nSo you cannot change your inner map it is what it is and and the best that you can do is make the way you go through life be as closely aligned as possible to that in a map.So one of the first thing  that two psychologists had told him because he was just about to start Pabrai Funds it was about three months before pabrai funds  - started and while then he was running an IT company with 160 people and they said to him that they actually don't even understand how he was able to function in this environment with all these people because so far away from where he was  and they said that they know it's not possible for a guy like him to involve with so many people altogether. \nMohnish Pabrai described to tell  them what Pabrai funds were going to look like and they said that looks perfectly aligned with what his inner map is and in fact one of them became one of the original investors in Pabrai funds.\nQuest:  Let's know about Entrepreneurs,you've had this belief that entrepreneurs take risk and people think they take risk and they get rewarded because they take risk but in reality and entrepreneur wants to do everything to minimize risks they want free lunches,if they can get them and go after them but is this the whole Dhandho investing framework that you talked about in the book and actually what is the story behind the framework in the name ?\nAnswer:  The common misconception is that entrepreneurs take too risk and so if we ignore venture-backed startups which are a completely different animal they represent less than 1/10 of 1% of all startups so we can we can ignore venture-backed startups they don't represent the reality of how 99.9 percent or more of businesses get started.\n So for an example of let's say a dry cleaner for example so there are two towns they're like 20- 30 miles apart and they have dry cleaners in both those towns and then there's a new Township coming up between those two towns let's call it town C and town C is coming up and this one cleaner notices that some people are driving quite a bit of distance to come to him because there's no dry cleaner than so he starts questioning the people there , that basically there's an opportunity because there's not writing is there so he might he might open a small shop there it might not even have any facilities just might be a place to take in and deliver clothes but still keep the back end at his main place he could minimize a risk of doing that by you know keeping the lease short and keeping the space small and so on so forth and then once it gets going he can scale that up and if it doesn't work he can pull that back and just go back to the way he was operating. \nSo basically the idea is that being an entrepreneur it doesn't matter you know you're running a restaurant or a gas station or whatever basically the the idea is that entrepreneurs look for arbitrage opportunities and as we understand arbitrage in markets pure arbitrage is risk and entrepreneurship is not risk-free but it's pretty low risk in the manner in which most entrepreneurs approach it so they try to do all kinds of things to make sure that the the downside is limited.\nNow coming to the word Dhandho so Mohnish Pabrai had one of his  roommate in college was a Gujarati guy in college in South California and  he had a bunch of relatives uncles who had different businesses motels laundromats you know 7/11 so on and so several times on the weekend he would disappear to meet different family members and  come back Sunday night he'd be like have all these stories of all these deals his relatives his uncle had to bought a new motel or whatever and then the end when he finished telling me all those stories. Later he would say Mohnish dhandho etle s The Dhandho Gujarati word that the direct translation is business but we know that what it really means is an approach to doing business which gives you upside the downside.\nQuest: Entrepreneurs money when you practice and approach that's upside with more downside and you say heads I win tails I lose I think it's very relevant for a market like India which is so chaotic.\n\n\nI mean it's economically chaotic it's also politically chaotic now how do you actually practice that kind of investing so do you have a checklist in mind and if you had to give people a bit because that's what everyone's trying to achieve in a market like India how do you practice that ? Is there a checklist that you have? What are the few things that you tell people who want to practice that kind of investing?\n\nAnswer: The checklist comes in a little later in the process as in the sense that you're trying to make sure you've thought about all the things you should think about before making investment.\n\nWhen you first encounter a business as a potential investment ,the first question you should be asking yourself is how would I lose money on this investment ? Not how I would make money but what are the ways in which things can go wrong and after that you can satisfy yourself that you can't easily come up with a scenario where things can go wrong.\nFocus on the downside,upside can take care of itself.\nSo what we really want to do in investing is we want to look for investments where the downside is very muted.\nQuest: One question I had is and this is the obvious question about crisis obviously you've seen 2008 you're seeing the current crisis around over you know whatever mistakes you've made in 2008 that you learned from and you feel that you held up better because of those during this period? \n\nAnswer: We're still going through the period. \nFor the time will tell but the number one area which had trouble in the portfolio has been making investments in leveraged businesses and buying leveraged financial institutions.\nAs Mohnish Pabrai runs a concentrated portfolio typically of ten investments, I think if the lesson I took from there is to stay as far away as I can from leveraged institutions and from in general staying away from all types of leverage business. \n\nHe doesn’t have any leverage in his portfolios and personally has no margin or anything like that. We don't go there but just want to make sure that even the businesses we get into typically are not in that space and you know when he talked about the checklist earlier.\n\nThe number one reason that value investors don't do well on their investments is the leverage they were like four or five large reasons why investments don't work out leverage was the number one you know some aspect of management of ownership and their ethos was another one and then you know some aspect of the moat, misunderstanding the competitive advantage was another one so these are three big ones but leverage is the biggest one.\n\nQuest: Is this post-pandemic and this crisis is different from the 2008 crisis?\nHow do you see it is different? I mean do you think is there a post covid investing world or is that too big of a phrase describing too much to this current crisis? \n\nAnswer: As of now, as we all know India loses about a hundred - thousand businesses a year that just happens normally in a normal economy in the US and we create more than 1,00,000 businesses then that whole creative destruction is what makes the economy destroyed way more than hundreds of businesses we've destroyed.\n\n\nIn his opinion probably hundreds of thousands of businesses and many of those will never come back because they are very fragile and to begin with you know you take some restaurant or some barbershop and such I mean these are difficult businesses they're surviving in a steady state in a very competitive environment it's hard to know it takes the pull the rug out from under them and have them come back.\n\n\nIndia's unemployment rate remained steady at 23.5% in May 2020, according to a survey conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). This was not a significant deviation from unemployment numbers in the previous month.\n\n\n\nSo I think that the recovery even though governments have taken very good action in terms of you know supporting it and supporting the financial system and all that in the u.s. we were at you know three odd percent unemployment we had the best job market in January in the history of the United States. \n\n\nIt was just the most amazing economy more than 160 million people employed we will probably not see that again in my opinion at least for at least five years and it may be beyond that might even be ten years so it's hard to know how long it will take the United States to get back to three % or for India to get those 100-125 million people back to work but it's not going to be this year it's not gonna be next year it's not gonna be it will not be whenever you're vaccinated we have created serious permanent damage to the global economy.\n\n\nQuest:  A related question from an Indian investor. What you know is one of the things that the Indian investor has been looking at and many people listening on the corners, they've been looking at the US market and you know you talked about the economic damage? \nSo how do you see the US market and the way it's moved and it's hard to talk about this given what has happened to the economy and the economic impact and for someone sitting in India who's looking to invest in the U.S also which is a lot of people today? \n\n\nAnswer: So the US markets for the most part have brushed off covid as an ordered event. I mean if you look at the decline in the stock indices on March 23rd was low but the economy's come I mean the stock markets come rolling back a lot of good news is priced in and to some extent, some of that may be justified because markets are forward-looking.\n\n\nI think the United States is you know superhuman economy it's a superstar economy it's the best most amazing economy on the planet with all the factors you know set up to unleash all the entrepreneurial energies of the country and such so it's an amazing creation will bounce back and the American spirit they will try to bounce back as quickly as possible. I think even two years from now we'll still be maybe at 7-8 %  unemployment.\n\n\nQuest: Markets have accurately discounted the macro covid events sitting in the US how they look at India I think India obviously is an economy that was probably in tough shape going into orbit we've been in the midst of a credit crisis since 2018 are there bright spots that you see in India and how do you see India kind of coming out of this?\n\n\nAnswer: India does a lot of self-inflicted wounds on itself so, for example, we know that there is an excellent exodus from manufacturing in China that started happening after the US government started imposing tariffs and there were lots and lots of companies that were looking at alternative places to China so they could continue to manufacture at competitive rates.\n \nVietnam for example picked up massive amounts of manufacturing from China and India, for example, picked up very little and the reason India picked up a little is we make it really really hard to attract the foreign investment we have so many rules that are backward and laws that are backward and they defy Ricardo they defy Adam Smith meaning the mantra for how to make a country rich is extremely well known you can study Lee Kuan Yew and you'll get there you can study Augustine Pinochet you can study the Chicago economics school you can study Adam Smith you can study Ricardo none of these models is what India photos and it blows my mind.\n\n\n That it's not like we have a lack of brains or at the center we have a lack of understanding of what makes an economy tick and how to make an economy like India work really well and grow really go at very high rates and some of that gets to work bank politics where once you start focusing on those types of factors then you can forget about great economic results or great growth rates. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The whole summary is based upon my understanding from the session taken by Radhika Gupta on 29 May 2020.

    "summary": "Art of investing by - Sajal Kapoor\n\n\n\nSHUCHI.P.NAHAR\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n Background\nSajal Kapoor is into the operational risk and regulatory compliance industry and within that industry, he has been working across domains from banking to healthcare to investment forms. \n\n\nOver the last 20- 25 years and that has been highly rewarding and productive because,\n\nThat gave him the opportunity to look at the world from a risk and compliance point of view.\n\nExperience that he got from the industry, experience working through banks and healthcare firms, consultancies, and investment firms gave him a sort of a different perspective, and somewhere in the background starting around the mid-90s this hunger and drive to know more about this animal called Mr. market and that started emerging.\n\n It has been a very long and rewarding journey it has had its own sort of ups and downs like any investor goes through and but those ups and downs are like the tuition fee that you pay and you get to get yourself up and running and so after some initial hiccups and there was an IPO boom going on in mid-nineties some money was lost of experience and he is always hunting for that unknown, unseen undiscovered and potentially undervalued business somewhere and that's being his journey.\n\n\n\nSajal Kapoor has also tried and restricted himself to the pockets where he has got some sort of inherent advantage. So he restricts himself to 3-4 sectors only and that kills the 80% of the universe. He will not even consider looking at that and by so its his professional and investing passion combined together that gave him a lot of unseen perspectives.\n\n\nInvesting Framework-  Seven Core Pillars\n\n\nAll seven pillars are important. Emphasizing one over the other will not justify the essence of the investing framework.\nOne important lesson for all we need is to keep learning, keep evolving and this is not done instantly, any imagination or sort of a rigid framework will keep evolving and as you go along. \nInvesting as we know is all about continuous learning so the moment you stop learning you'll start crashing.\n\nCircle of Competence\n\nManagement\n\nIndustry structure\n\nBusiness economics \n\nPsychology \n\nNarrative and Numbers\n\nCycle and valuations\n\n\n\nCircle of Competence\n\nOver a period of time after losing money in certain sectors and gaining disproportionately and some of the other sectors coupled with his sort of professional career and background he understood that it's very important to stick to your circle of competence.\n\n\nAs Warren Buffet says it doesn't matter how big your circle of competence is as long as you know the boundaries and that's fine and the whole benefit of staying inside the circle of competence is that you don't have to be better than and everyone everywhere right and so you just aim to win in the league in which you play.\n\n\n And the league in which Sajal Kapoor plays is all about sustainable long-term compounding businesses the pharmaceuticals be chemicals he has played some autos as well these are the four key pockets.\n\n\n He has  played over the years and as I call them that circle of components is tend amount \nto circle of luck so the more you shrink your circle and the greater your luck quotient goes up the other thing is that it's easy to learn from your mistakes.\n\n\nSo if you are playing within a restricted sort of COC and mistakes will tend to happen mistakes as Sajal Kapoor says he has made mistakes in pharmaceuticals, made mistakes in FMCG and he has made mistakes even in my very small tiny circle.\n\n\nBut you will find it easier to learn from those mistakes because you know the boundaries of yours and of your circle of competence and there was a tweet that he did last year from Joel and that said that “choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you are looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. you may live but you are still an idiot” because you don't know what you don't know and that's the reason and defining a circle of competence is important.\n\n\nBasic General guidance to new entrants\nQuest: If someone wants to invest in equity, how do one realize or identify stocks around the\ncircle of competence says for example If someone is into the business of chemicals so how do someone identify the circle of competence with less background in investing?\nAns: So if you are in the chemical industry you have an inherent advantage you understand the supply chain dynamics you can talk to your suppliers you talk to your business partners so you know the end-to-end chain and the trade channel and so on.\nThat is giving you some edge but investing is slightly different so you have the domain knowledge but then what is suggested is such a person should start attending AGM and start attending con calls.\n\n\nStart reading the controls of not only the companies that you want to invest into but as many as possible within that sector and try and connect your thoughts in terms of where the puck will likely be not where it is today you don't make money from historic earnings market rewards the future potential or the Delta relative to the valuation.\n\n\nSo you need to understand where the puck will likely be and for that, you need to, unfortunately, do some hard work and go through the Con calls go through the annual reports,  AGM and if you're not confident there is no shame in investing through mutual funds, to begin with, and have your own logbook of your learning and then take notes through these channels.\n\n\nThe importance of reading as many con calls as you can and the reading over the years annual report is of great importance but this whole journey may take some time right it's not going to happen tomorrow and in the meanwhile not to miss out the compounding opportunity you can start investing through a good mutual fund. \n\nManagement\n\nThe second important pillar in my framework is management and and and you cannot get this pillar wrong because anything multiplied by zero as raamdeo agrawal says quite often is zero and many people have said so so the management is the allocator of the capital is and it's the agent and the managing our business and you can't get that wrong.\n\n\n So having skin in the game: is important so management should have some material ownership of the business and typically Sajal Kapoor says he go for nothing less than 30% in the Indian context but he may prefer less globally, so if it's a well-diversified large business like a Lanza or the GSK or a Unilever he doesn't care because they're professionally managed managers.\n He won't care about the promoter stay because the promoter is usually a sleeping entity in those businesses but talking more from an Indian context he thinks 30%  is the sort of the threshold minimum threshold that he has used and usually comfortable. \n\n\nWalking the talk by this he means management could talk the talk in an endless manner but if they are not actually implementing and not following it up with some concrete action or ground then that that doesn't make sense.\n\n\nHow to validate? Sajal Kapoor suggests going through the con calls or past annual reports and where they show an example further down and you need to go back five-ten years look up the annual reports and if the con calls, just randomly pick up and try and connect the dots that you know what the management was telling say in 2010 or 2015 and how much of that has actually transformed into implementation and action in terms of taking the business forward.\n\n\nSo that's another critical point and also how do they react to stock movements if the stock price is correcting how do they react if the stock price is rising how do they behave and some see that on the annual report they say their market capitalization has gone up by some percent or in the next five years they want to be at a certain market cap as the management.\n\n\nSo be wary of them, management cannot control that.  It's not within their sort of powers they cannot control the external environment they don't control the cycle,  they can just control their balance sheet.\n\n\nSo if management is quoting some sort of growth it's an important sort of red indicator if the management is talking about a more interested in a stock price and also listen to their interviews and see how they interact with the stakeholders how they answer queries on the con calls and what's been there a capital allocation track record you get it from the ROCE and that type of thing any known integrity issues of fraud just do google talk to people and you will get some sense there and lastly what about their strategy,  is the strategy been consistent or not? \n\n\nLet's take the example of Biocon, Kiran Majumdar she is active on all social platforms and people find it inappropriate but her goal is to develop blockbuster molecule, ones that could benefit the masses so it's all about affordable innovation and look at the scale of that the business has done right from 50 crores to 318 million in revenues to it's 55 billion rupees and plus in 20 years so a huge scale-up has happened and the chatter and the noise were very negative all throughout but that's where you need to sort of differentiate between the noise versus the voice.\n\nIndustry structure\n\nThe next sort of pillar the third pillar which is the industry structure and the devil is always in\nin the detail so if you read a good book from Pat Dorsey there is also a little book that builds wealth and I remember there was a quote along the lines that moats are always absolute and not relative.\n\n\nOn this company in an instruction effective industry could well be better having a wider mode relative to the best company in a brutally competitive industry like a commodity so that quote from a little book that builds wealth it's a great book I would encourage but superficially when you look at the industry structure you may think that it's all about Porter's five forces.\n\n\nour suppliers,  the threat of substitutes, and so on but it's much deeper and wider than that because there are geopolitical pressures, there are regulatory aspects especially in the industries where Sajal Kapoor invest, like in the chemicals and pharma.\n\n\nPharma sector directly is an umbrella industry in itself because you can look at the generics and that will be completely different from API's and then you've got biologics,  biosimilars,  innovators these small big innovators,  virtual biotechs and each of these is a sort of a mini-industry in its own.\n\n\nBecause the five forces and the industry dynamics are very different and so there is no such thing as the pharmaceutical industry,  that's the myth there are ten different sorts of industries within that umbrella and you got to have a very clear understanding of the dynamics play out because the dynamics are very different across generics and the innovator even the custom synthesis the content development and CDM or crams as we sometimes each of these sorts of components are very different in terms of the industry structure and when the industry structure turns from negative to positive you make money.\n\n\nChemical industry structure was in 2012 because China started withdrawing and the whole structure and something similar happened with the cement industry 20- 25 years ago cement industry today is very stable it wasn't like that in the mid-90s. If you want to trade a stock you have to analyze this stock you know the technicals the head and shoulders and whatnot the cup and fill them all your cycle but if you want to invest you have to analyze the industry structure and the underlying business and then so that's a very fundamental third pillar in my framework.\n\nBusiness Economics\n\nThe fourth pillar that is all about these sort of business economics and all as Charlie Munger says that almost all good businesses engage in pain today and gain tomorrow so you need to invest in capabilities and capacities upfront and the cash will come at a later point in time and this cycle is different for every business.\n\n\nSo the example of a pharmaceutical business if you are setting up a cream-filled facility it's a four to five year gestation period assuming that you are targeting the regulated market the unregulated markets maybe two to three years but no less than that so the capital allocation will not be known tomorrow so if you're putting up a greenfield facility and you want to make complex API's or injectables or the highly regulated markets of Japan and yes it's a five-year game approximately and at the end of that when the cash starts and coming out you would figure out whether the management was right in calling that out.\n\n\nUnderstanding the economics of the industry they saw what was happening in the world and implementing it up front in their own companies. Example to go for the backward integration and this is all the size of the opportunity and the other important dynamics in this business economist is the entry barriers because of the opportunity is huge but there are no entry barriers as so for solar industry for the economics of the business will get killed no one would make money you need to worry about the entry barriers and of course, the capital efficiency which is and of course how clean is the balance sheet, because the quality of the business is easy to quantify you look at the balance sheet in a down-cycle at the bottom of this we look at the cash flows.\n\nPsychology\n\nThe psychology of the market as well as your own psychology, what kind of investor you are, what are your goals, what are your aims, what are your objectives and you need to align the two so the first thing is to try and understand yourself.\n\n\nThen decodes that investing lies at the intersection of economics and psychology and the place where the net present value means freedom and greed and fear and everyone is doing this DCF analysis and all the rest of it but these are all about under evaluation overvaluation and the psychology of the market participants from immense fear to extreme euphoria they will keep repeating and if you understand the psychology. \n\n\nIf you understand the business if you understand the domain in which you are playing inside a circle of competence you can have a reasonable estimate not an accurate estimate reasonable, an estimate of the likely value of that and if the market is giving you a good opportunity to buy and you move because if you see that this is a significant discount because of the market and excelling or whatever and if there is an extreme euphoria.\n\nNarrative and Numbers\n\n\nThe narrative must be seen in numbers ( over the period )\n\nCFO has to compound overtime\n\nMarket value= NPV of future cash streams\n\nNarrative and Numbers and this is something that has evolved in recent years and that the narrative has to match the numbers The numbers have to match the narrative one without the other is not game. Mostly in pharmaceutical business ratios like CFO/EBITDA, not less than 0.6 or we can track enterprise value or operating cash flows, ROE or ROCE, WACC, CFO or FCF, EV TO CASH SALES.\n\n\nDon't invest or liquidate.\nLook at the enterprise value you look at the operating profits you look at the cash flows and you look at for a better ratio so typically in anything less than 0.6 for CFO to EBITDA  is a red flag.\n Some companies so jubilant Life Sciences for example did this propose at 250 or something recently but if you look at the CFO to a better ratio for jubilant Life Sciences is one of the best in the industry it's 0.8 you almost have to match the narrative and try to just extent.\n\nThe other example is the Tyche Industry. They haven't done anything else far as the cash flow is concerned the stock may be busing along. It was buzzing around yesterday as well and it's an industry company. But the highlight that looks if you look at their operating cash it has done nothing from point to point it has done nothing it has it's up and down but it should be a gradient of 30-40 degrees right something like this.\n \nOne Another is positive Solara pharma again early listing only two-three years of cash but they started scaling up quite well and that's what is likely to see in the businesses that over time the cash should be growing because see if you are getting good operating cash flow and if the management is prudent they can find some growth Capex and opportunities to utilize that cash it could be an M&A it could be an organic initiative. so focus has to be on the balance sheet focus has to be on the operating cash flows.\n\nCycle and Valuations\n\nRefrain from valuing business on P/E or P/B  when the past few years have been miserable or wonderful.\nInstead one should focus on EV/Free Cash Flow or EV/OCF.\nThe final pillar is all about this cycle and evaluations and so there are multiple cycles that come into play. There's always that GDP or the economic cycle is a concrete cycle and the most important cycle is the business cycle because The business cycle is about to turn, where the market cycle is or the economic cycle is so the economy may suffer but pharmaceutical chemical companies may do relatively better even as opposed to some of the more and heavy industrial sectors that are heavier and they need the real economy. \n\n\nYou know the CAPEX play for example and so the business cycle you need to understand the business cycle that where is it in the business cycle if the capacity has been extended or expanded for some niche launches and the business is about to turn into a positive cycle and regardless of where the market of the economic cycle is the gains will flow if the market cycle is conducive and is helping that are a couple of extra percentage point view gains but 80% of the gains will come from the business cycle you get the business cycle wrong and you cannot make money regardless of where the economic cycle is regardless. The business cycle is very important and again you get it from Con Calls,  annual reports, and the AGM. \n\n\nThe business cycle used to be a 6-7-year-old cycle you don't know actually the business cycle will last for three years or one years or five years. How do you deal with that predictive model and whether you can actually predict the business cycle anymore? \n\n\nSo you cannot time the cycles if they are getting shorter and shorter so that's a very valid great point in fact the way the cycles are getting shorter but you still cannot predict it is a good thing in the sense that generation takes a lot of based out of companies start and getting more frugal people are realizing that a lot of the cost can be taken off the P&L because things can be done remotely and so on so the new world will look very different.\n\n\nThe cycles are getting shorter and they are very credible and because they are unpredictable you should try and predict what you can do which is again balance sheet and cash flow and sheet in cash flow but that's ROA, ROC metrics. \n\n\nSo the business that has the potential to keep the weighted average cost of capital down has the potential to incrementally improve the ROA & ROC through fresh and CAPEX or internal improvements and has the capability to compound the cash flow.\n\n\nThat will create wealth. It will create a lot of wealth if you are prepared to hold such a business for a longer and duration and don't worry about the day to day price generation because in 10-20-30% of all coming understand the business have a conviction to understand the industry structure and follow some sort of framework.\n\n\nIf you are too much obsessed with the numbers and the ratios you will unlikely make a serious success. As Peter Lynch was one of the early guys that Sajal Kapoor started following, read his books and he has got immense respect and credibility.\n\n\nBut Sajal Kapoor has a framework more on the investing side and to build that knowledge you would have to start from somewhere so again he says keep reading,  keep reading, about the business keep reading about other businesses in the same sector, and pick just one sector.\n\n\nKeep repeating the same thing for every sector you pick and follow the same rigorous process every time.\n\n\nThanks to Face2Face hosted by Vivek Bajaj  Co-Founder of stock edge & Elearnmarkets.com.\nIt was a great and insightful session from Sajal Kapoor, a must-watch session. \nLooking forward to learning from you, sir.\n  \nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

Sajal Kapoor suggests going through the con calls or past annual reports and where they show an example further down and you need to go back five-ten years look up the annual reports and if the con calls, just randomly pick up and try and connect the dots that you know what the management was telling say in 2010 or 2015 and how much of that has actually transformed into implementation and action in terms of taking the business forward.</font></span></p><font><br /></font><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38;

    "summary": "Pharma Outlook by the sector veteran Aditya Khemka\nTwitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar\nPharma business is divided into two models:\n\nDomestic \n\nExport \n\n\nDomestic Model\n\nThis model is typically like an FMCG business. In domestic markets, those pharma companies that have branding power will have a good pricing power among other competitors. \n\n\nIn pharma, doctors are the main customer of the product and the patient is just a consumer. The patient is going to follow what the doctor suggests and he will prefer only those drugs that will be suggested by a doctor, he won't switch to a generic drug if he is not getting the brand prescribed to him.\n\nExport Model \n\nThis model is basically like a steel business. A demand curve is almost always downward-sloping, reflecting the willingness of consumers to purchase more of the commodity at lower price levels. \nThe pharma demand curve is going to be straight, so the question here is what will determine the price?\nThe answer is simple, supply will determine the demand. The company that can afford the lowest price is going to have the highest market share. \n\n\n\nPharma Rally in 2015 \nThis pharma rally was observed in the sector mainly due to export. As earnings growth and valuation were re-rating,  ROE was 20-25% it was attracting new competitors in the market.\nAs competitors started to step into the industry the price wars among the players started which ultimately separated the wheat from the chaff. \n\n\nCurrent Scenario of the industry \nCurrently, the ROE stands at 10-15% which is low in comparison to the past few years. Indian players have the two largest competitors in branded drugs i.e European markets and American markets. \nTo revive the sector supply needs to be controlled and that has started happening gradually. \nMany big pharma companies in the USA are filing bankruptcies or getting merged or getting out of the markets. which slowly and gradually is going to control the supply and help the sector revive.\n\n\nPrice to Book value Revival\nPrice to book value is reviving. A price war is slowly and gradually declining as the best will survive, soon price inflation can be observed.\n\n\nIn recent times it can be seen that pharma stocks have started picking up, it's just a fact that the sector has just corrected itself, from the bottom of P/B value of the 2.5 sectors is trading around 4-5 P/B and has its own peak of 7-8 P/B.\n\n\nCurrently, this hype in prices is observed due to various investors from different sectors like cement, steel, media, etc have started to invest in pharma companies looking at stable growth. \nUSFDA will be seen to go lenient on terms of inspection approvals as they will be more focusing on the supply side of the drugs in US markets. \n\n\nMore consolidation to be seen\nThere is going to be more handshakes with other companies. As loss-making companies would not be able to survive alone will join their hands with other companies which will be a value addition for the companies and some fixed cost will get clubbed which will remove cost and add the synergies. \nPharma is a globally competitive industry, those companies having moats will have no fear of facing price wars among competitors.\n\n\nPradhanmantri Jan Aushdhi yojana\nA campaign launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Government of India, to provide quality medicines at affordable prices to the masses through special kendras known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra. \nPradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana Kendra (PMBJPK) has been set up to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs. \nBut pharmacies that are set up for this yojna are usually less appreciated, whereas the government also provides subsidies for the initial two years, and after that those pharmacies are usually turned into grocery stores to compensate their fixed cost in the long run. \n\n\nMedical technology and medical devices (Blessing in disguise)\nThis modern artificial intelligence in the pharma sector, effectively is going to be the future for the healthcare sector and will help the patients, doctors in an effective manner but will slowly and gradually disrupt the whole traditional markets going on in India, sooner or later. \nThere is a long runway for growth in this domain of the sector. \nIn India, there are hardly any players that have diversified themselves in this domain, but there are lots of opportunities to be grabbed in near future in AI for pharma companies.\n\n\n\nUS Markets \nDrug manufacturing prices are higher by 25-30% in the US in comparison to India. \nHealthcare is closest to the heart of consumers. A trade war between China and the US will gradually give some space to developments of Indian players in US markets as Indian manufacturers hold 47% of the volume share in the US.\n\n\nCRAMS business\nIn the export model this type of business won't get affected. The CRAMS model is supported by some tailwinds. CRAMS is a type of business where they have their fixed return as per the contract allocated to those companies. \nDrug selling pressure is going to stay on other players who have their business of selling , packaging of the drugs. \nCRAMS players are just service players and not drug sellers. \nChina has a 55bn model when it comes to CRAMS and India has a 5bn market share due to anti china scenario, the demand from Chinese players is going to reduce and India has its foot to capture those markets. Companies with pure-play CRAMS models are expected to grow in near future.\n\n\nSome Cherry on the top Points:\nHealthcare is the consumer-driven market, though your income rises or reduces you are not going to switch from a branded drug to a generic on the cost of your health.\nHow safe your cash is known from how sustainable that company has cash flows and not from how big that company is.\nWhen per capita GDP increases it will simultaneously increase healthcare expenses.\nDeveloping economies will always focus on branded drugs.\nThe government banned an irrational combination of drugs.\nPharma is a government-protected industry so competition in the domestic players is bound to be seen.\nMost pharma companies do business in spite of having low ROE, having a good risk appetite of suffering loss for 10-15 years, and then earn for 5 years but gradually such companies get merged with sustainable players.\nCompanies focusing on chronic therapies will have growth opportunities. \nDue to this covid 19 affect healthcare and pharma spending globally will go up.\n\nThis summary is totally based on the learning that I gained during the webinar held by ZEN MONEY (DSP Mutual Fund) conducted by Aditya Khemka on 23 May 2020. It was a great learning experience to learn from the sector expert.\n\nFor more updates : @shuchi_nahar",

    "summary": "Field Guide to Investing by Neeraj Marathe ( CFA Society India)\nTwitter: shuchi_nahar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here is the article that will definitely widen the thinking horizon before investing in stocks just by listening to markets. It's a compilation of my understanding from the webinar that I attended.\n\n\n\nThe start of a new year is always one of the best times to review your investment strategy. We know what happened last year, but 2020 is a chapter waiting to be written. One thing we can count on is that 2020 won’t be exactly like 2019. \n\nThat means no one would have ever thought that 2020 will bring all the unexpected to us. These are the times that were nightmares but anyhow the world is surviving. Staying without work, without income, far from families , pandemic, fire and so on but as its said every coin has two sides lets not forget the good ones.\n\n\nUnprecedented Times\n\n\n\nNever has the world been so connected.\n\n\nNever has the world come to halt.\n\n\nNever has there been such levels of debt.\n\n\nNever have the basic laws of economics/finance been broken.\n\n\nNever has there been such a response from the government.\n\n\nNever has there been such disruption for business. \n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CBO \n\nIn times of pandemic where the whole world is at a halt, businesses are stopped, people are sitting at home and there is no progress in the economy and debt level are increasing, future growth has gone for a toss.\nRising debt and deficits are driven by the disconnect between spending and revenue. \nCBO projects annual spending will grow by $2.8 trillion from $4.7 trillion (21.3 % of GDP) in 2020 to $7.5 trillion (23.4 % of GDP) by 2030. \n\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, will remain between 16.4 % and 17.1 % of GDP through 2025 and then rise to 17.9 % of GDP by 2030 as a result of the expiration of most individual income tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n\n\nWhat it means for us.\n\n\nLearning from history is limited.\n\n\nThere is no playbook for this.\nNeed to revisit everything.\nReactive, not predictive\nJust write down what you understand.\nMaintain your decision journal.\nUnderstand your basics, and then search sectors accordingly\nSectors, where people gather, are there to go for a toss.                                \nHaving a habit of the journal will not waste your time but lead you to invest your money efficiently.\nUnderstand your basics, and then search sectors accordingly.\nSectors, where people gather, are there to go for a toss.\nThose that will hurt:- Travel, NBFC, Malls, Theaters.\nContinue as usual like cement, FMCG, auto, agriculture.\nThose will benefit:- Pharma, Chemical,IT.\n\nStart writing things down, don't justify yourself.\n\n\n\nEvery individual should make their own decision journal , it helps one understand the reason for buying the stock and while selling it. \nReason for making decision journal is simple when you write things you have clear idea rather than just keeping in mind. \n\n\n\nThe broad thought process.\n\n\nIf you are invested already, stay optimistic.\n\n\nThink of existing positions as cash to be deployed anew.\n\n\nDon't wait for the right price to come and then you sell it , buying at right price matter most rather than selling.\n\n\nIf you have cash at this point in time, deploy sensibly.\n\n\nThere is no one cash-call-fits-all. Comfort & understanding matters.\n\n\nStaying on 20% cash, considering the extreme uncertainty is healthy allocation, we don't have to be fully invested when markets are down and have nothing for the time for uncertainty\n\n\nDon’t deploy everything and keep something for uncertainty.\n\n\nThe market gives you either certainty or valuation, never both!\n\n\nThere can be chances where you don’t find any good investment, but you won’t get both together.\n\n\nValuation and numbers are the cornerstones.\n\n\nInvest carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should one be doing?\n\n\nIt’s time to focus.\n\n\nFocus -  Don’t jump all over the place.\n\n\n\n\nEverything is falling. That doesn't mean we have to own everything that has bottom rocked , step when you understand , not when others make you understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t jump on things that are new to your understanding \n\n\nIf you jump to something. That is new to you , you wont understand them though they have fallen you’ll lose time opportunity that you wasted on something new rather than in investing in something that you already had an expertise in. Focus on that industry which you have already have a foot in , jumping to market noises will either make you deaf or a great fall. \n\n\nJust because we are analysts doesn’t mean we have to sit and analyze on every other next thing we see, we don't have to be jack of all and master of none. We are good at analyzing companies let's stick to that!\n\n\nYour portfolio will not consist of the best stock (in hindsight) except that.\n\n\nDon’t start something new right now, Thinking just for short-term gains.\n\n\n\nAvoid Complexities\n\n\nComplex Companies - like multiple Joint ventures ,Subsidiary, multiple business ,multiple products.\n\n\nYou won’t understand every subsidiary.\n\n\nDo not get into any flavor of the month: Like Pharma. Chemical\n\n\n\n\nThey are trading on high valuation.\n\n\nRe-evaluate every holding.\n\n\nIf you have researched and Price is falling , it should not really bother you. If its good business - Don't panic (Hold stocks,with deeper conviction.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey wont help you make money or make you look smarter if you know complex business but it will definitely lose your focus from something you are really good at.\n\nWhat should one check before Investing?\n\nFew checklist pointers that will help us from not losing money, but surely making one.\n\nNo Balance sheet risk (nature, number).\n\n\nLow complexity business.\n\n\nA large part of the business is India Centric.\n\n\nNo promoter/management risk.\n\n\nNo history of default. Not interconnected with each other.\n\n\nWhen you cannot reach a business completely - avoid that\n\n\nBusiness having moat, but not attractive from a valuation.\n\n\nGood Dividend, Earnings, Cash Flow, Asset value. We should have a good command over these. Look at some valuation parameters. Not overall parameters.\n\n\nSmall/micro caps.\n\n\n\nNow they are available at super valuation.\n\n\nDon’t close eyes to small caps.\n\n\nIf you are uncomfortable in investing in small caps / make a smaller position don’t avoid them completely.\n\n\nWe can never predict the bottom.\n\n\nJust buying at your level is important, buying at the right price matters\n\n\n\nFrom the fundamental price - we can predict some sense of price, but technical will help decide the selling price more efficiently.\n\n\nA business that will revive in the short term.\n\n\nBusinesses that are serving the old economy.\n\n\nSome businesses don't get affected by global economics.\n\n\nSimpler the business, simpler to understand.\n\n\n\nValuation Driven\n\n\nCash - Not finding something according to your understanding, its fine to sit on cash.\n\n\nWhen valuation makes sense - That this the time to Invest.\n\n\nEstimate your fair value of the business. The buying price is the most important factor. If something that doesn’t come on your estimated buying price wait till it comes. \n\n\nVolatility in the markets.\n\n\nValue enough is not okay. he value should be driven with change. Why it would get expensive, should be the first thing to pop up?\n\n\nPrice is reducing - but what is changing. Only if it is getting cheaper is not sufficient\n\n\nIs Something significant happened and that is giving opportunity for business to grow ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it India Centric business? \n\n\nHow to decide when to book profit.\n\nThings are very dynamic.\n\n\nWhen you purchase something with a targeted price for 9-12 months.\n\n\nIf you get the price 60-70% from your targeted price.\n\n\nIn a bull market, the mind will tell you to wait but in bear market it will help you to decide whether to sell or hold.\n\n\nThe logical extension - decision journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle of Competence\n\n\nKnowing what you know is very important.\n\n\nBut knowing what you don’t know is more important.\n\n\nDefining COC is most important. Do it on paper.\n\n\nMarrying this concept with a checklist and decision journal helps.\n\n\nDefine a circle of incompetence also.\n\n\nLook for COC in companies you analyse too.\n\n\nAlways remember, there is no compulsion to invest . MOVE ON!!!\n\n\nDo not avoid COC because of your laziness.\n\n\n\n Expanding your Circle Of Competence\n\n\nPick up an industry you find interesting. Preferably something you can relate to.\n\n\nPick up the best performer in the industry and the worst.\n\n\nDownload all material related to both (AR’s, concalls, corporate PPTs,industry reports, broker reports, media etc.)\n\n\nPen down value drivers of the business, visit industry people talks!\n\n\nRevise and Repeat.\n\n\nThis report is wholly based on my understanding and my knowledge gained during the webinar held on 6th June 2020. The notes that will be shared here will be just for knowledge purposes. All the points covered here are the points I fathom during the webinar and have prepared a small note over that.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided on Shuchi Nahar’s Weekend Blog is for educational purposes only.

    "summary": "Selling- Art and Science \nShuchi.P.Nahar\n\n\nWhen it comes to selling , everyone of us at some point of time had faced some basic questions, like When to sell? How to decide the right time? What is the right price to exit?\nAnd just to have some sense of confidence we ask in our groups , friends ,peers ; \nkya nikal jaaye ? sahi price aagya kya? uppar jaayega yaha se? Kya lagta hei hold kare ya average out ?\nsomething or the other we must have asked or thought before taking the exit .\n\n\nSo here is the article , that will definitely not tell you the exact price to exit the stock but will surely widen the thinking horizon before selling the stock. Its the compilation of  my understanding from various articles that I read past week . Thanks neeraj sir for sharing such valuables. \n\n\nLet me start by saying that selling is the hardest thing to do well as an investor. I don’t think anyone does it well consistently, and that includes the whole slew of investing greats past and present  that I’ve studied. Everyone has sold something only to see it rise higher. And everyone has held onto something only to give back lots of apparent gains.\nSecond, hold onto stocks blindly. Great investors have always written : Advice to buy right and hold on is intended to counter unproductive activity, not to recommend putting them away and forgetting them.\n\n\nSometimes, selling half is costly, as you say. Other times, selling half looks smart. \n\n\n\nSelling your stocks at the right time is arguably the most challenging part of trading and it is fraught with emotions!   There are times when we are wrong and we must exit at a loss – that is hard!  There are times when we buy strong stocks that perform very well, We tend to sell these too early because we doubt that the strength can last.\nThen there is the pain of watching a winning trade turn into a loser because we fail to exit at all!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinner and Wolf sum up:\n“These proactive portfolio adjustments do not represent a change in fund management’s fundamental approach to analyzing businesses and the prices of their securities, nor does it mean that we are now engaged in ‘market timing.’ We time our entry and exit from securities positions based upon fundamental valuations, not on expectations of price movements in the market.”\nIn the end, what you want to do is go in as a buy-and-hold investor. You want the effects of compounding to work for you, as well as the favorable tax treatment that goes along with buy-and-hold. So I think it is important to enter every new investment with a buy-and-hold mentality. Even modest rates of return pile up to extraordinary heights over time. But you also want to be alert to when your thesis is no longer true.\n\nWhen the main thesis for owning the stock vanishes, it’s often a good time to go. If a great balance sheet is one of the reasons you own something, for example, and it does a deal that makes the balance sheet weak, then it’s time to go. Or if you bought a stock because of a big gap between the stock price and NAV and that gap closes, then it’s time to at least think about selling. This is probably my favorite reason to sell. \n\n\nThe bottom line: There is no magic way to sell to ensure maximum gains every time out. \n\n\nI think anytime you sell, you could cost yourself money if that stock turns out to be a big winner. I understand that risk. On the other hand, as Third Avenue shows, there are also risks in getting too complacent about a holding. When the market gives you a great price to sell, you should be willing to at least think about reducing your position. As long as valuations remain reasonable, though, you may hold a stock indefinitely as the stock and the value of the business grow together over time.\n\n\n\nFundamental Exits: Pros & Cons\nLet’s define a fundamental approach to selling as exiting a trade when the stock’s price is greater than its fundamental value. Put that up against the technical approach.   Selling a stock when there is a signal from its trading activity that the stock is more likely to go lower than higher.\nWhile the notion that we should sell a stock if its price is higher than its fundamental value makes a lot of sense, there are major problems in its application.\nShould you sell when the stock is overpriced? We are operating in one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies and businesses are nowhere close to saturation. For us, a 5% or 6% growth is a slowdown. We have a lot of growth to see and our businesses have very long runways of future growth ahead. Businesses that can deliver growth without stretching balance sheets and without taking in more capital (through the issuance of new equity shares) and where the quality of growth is excellent in terms of incremental returns on capital—they will increase per share value for stock holders over the long term. \nThat potential growth in value is sometimes mispriced by markets even if the stock has appreciated a lot already. Under those circumstances, it would be a mistake to sell. You shouldn’t look at how much money you’ve made, but look at the potential value of the business 10 or 15 years down the road and then take a decision. \nDo not focus on the stock price but on performance of the underlying business. As Warren Buffet says, focus on the playing field, not the scoreboard. Too many investors look at the score board; they tend to focus on the current stock price, the current P/E multiple or the percentage gain in the stock price in relation to the gains in some index or some other stocks.\nSell Signal: P&L Based Exit\nOther people sell when a stock drops below their predetermined risk level. Meaning they say I don’t want to lose more than X% on this stock from entry to exit and then raise the stop as the stock rallies.\nTrailing stops can be used and adjusted for any of these strategies.\nThere are many other sell signals but this is just an intro to some of the most common.\nThis approach is not without its faults. The most common mistake that traders make is taking a too short-term view for the trading style that they are applying. If you are a longer term trader looking for entry signals on a daily chart then you should not be looking for trend line breaks on an intraday chart. It is probably best to look for a longer term entry signal using a weekly chart.\nAs good traders say, the profit is in the patience.\nWhile remaining disciplined in terms of the process of stock-picking, the seasoned value investor waits patiently for Mr. Market to provide opportunity. Typically, there are just four reasons to sell:\n\n\nA clear deterioration in either earning power or ‘asset’ value.\nMarket price exceeds ‘fair’ value by a meaningful margin.\nThe primary assumptions, or expected catalysts, identified prior to making the investment are unlikely to materialise or are proven to be flawed.\nAn opportunity likely to yield superior returns (with a high degree of certainty) as compared to the least attractive current holdings is on offer.\n\n\n\nNow that the selling compass is pointing in the right direction, perhaps one needs to come to grips with the tribulations of putting these simple ideas into practice. \nThe longer I think about why this plagues even expert investors, the more I am struck by the fact that ‘selling smart’ is the dark continent of investing. Just to set the record straight, can you think of more than a couple of books with worthwhile insights on ‘how to sell’ as opposed to the countless investment bestsellers on every other conceivable topic of relevance? \nShould you sell because another stock looks better? If something is working for you, and you don’t have cash and if something else turns up and you like it a lot, then you should sell what’s working for you only when what you want to buy will give you a significantly higher expected return. Otherwise, just hold on to your great businesses and let them compound your capital for you.\nSo what can we do to avoid costly and annoying errors?\n\n\nApproach investment decisions from as neutral a position as possible\nIgnore all sunk costs by ignoring the cost of the investment when reviewing your portfolio\nAccept it as inevitable that you will make mistakes in your buying decisions\nYou will face tremendous pressure that will tempt you to rationalize your mistakes and not correct them\n\nYou will tend to protect the status quo by inventing new reasons to hold on to a bad investment\n\nThis will be especially true when your original buying decision is known to many other people who are important to you, as it will hurt you to acknowledge this to them, and to yourself.\nIt will be difficult for you to correct the mistake because you will attach more importance to saving face by appearing to be consistent with your past commitments.\n\nDon’t overvalue your current positions. Pretend that you don’t own them, and ask, “If I didn’t own this stock today, would I buy it?” If the answer is no, you should think hard about selling.\nDon’t compound past mistakes for fear of embarrassment. In the end, the best advice is to learn from mistakes and move on.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, the small profits arising from good luck rather than skill are swiftly pocketed, but whenever a paper loss is sustained the normal investor accounts for it as a ‘long-term investment’ and eventually the lack of skill overwhelms the mis-classification. A third, trickier, phenomenon occurs when a stock rises smartly and then slips into a gradual, but steady decline. In this instance, the issue is a loss of profits! \n\n\nThis fall causes far less pain, but is just as negative. Two simple rules come to mind. First, what works for me personally, after years of coping with unremitting losses is to sell out completely whenever a new investment shrinks by more than 15 percent. Not only does this deal with my dumber prejudices and blind spots in a ruthlessly efficient manner, more importantly it frees capital. With ‘dead money’ it is probably best to sell one-third, maybe even half the holding rather than the entire position simply because such stocks occasionally experience incredibly short, sharp rebounds. That is probably the moment to get rid of the rest! \n\n\nWhen you are carrying out a portfolio review, resist the temptation to sell the stocks with the best profits. Instead, relentlessly focus on selling the companies which meet the BBBB test — bent, broken or beyond belief!\n\n\n\nThe decision to sell is complicated. One needs the right dosage of detachment, but then one also needs to be very much attached to the right kinds of businesses and people who run them. The first thing to ask is whether the business is delivering what you envisaged. By and large, is the business is delivering performance in line with your long-term projections? Some slippages must be tolerated. \n\n\nSome mis-allocation of capital decisions must be tolerated. It’s important to not measure this performance every quarter. Just because the information is available, you don’t have to use it. Imagine if companies were required to provide monthly performance, not just quarterly. How important would those numbers be? More data does not result in more insights. Often, it results in bad judgments. Equally important is to determine whether or not that performance is coming from variables envisaged and not some other factor. \n\n\nIf the answer to that is overwhelmingly yes, then you could get pleasantly surprised as great businesses tend to do better than earlier envisaged. So, to help determine if you should hold or sell a business that’s really working for you, use what I call as blue sky scenario. Basically, it means that you should not use the same assumptions you used when you bought the stock. This is especially true when the business you bought into is doing far better than you had anticipated. \n\n\nIf you bought the right type of business, then there is likely to be tendency for it to deliver better than what you envisaged. If you see that tendency play out after you have invested, don’t ruin it by staying with the original model. Your model has to be adaptive. If the performance is far better (or worse) than you envisaged, you have to change the model unless the improvement (or deterioration is likely to be temporary).\n\n\n\nIs investing in equities only about buying good stocks? Let us recall some blockbusters of yesteryears— Jubilant Foods, Just Dial, DLF, Wockhardt, Financial Technologies, BHEL, SAIL, GMR, Kingfisher, Idea, Airtel and Satyam. Not only Indian companies, let us also recall some global bluechips such as Kodak, Blackberry and Nokia. How have these stocks performed in recent years?\n\n\n\n\nTheir price performances have not been up to the mark. In fact, most of them have under performed for several years\n\n\n Their price performances have not been up to the mark. In fact, most of them have under performed for several years. The lesson is simple: while buying good stocks is certainly a critical part of investing, taking exit calls at the opportune time is also important.\n\n\n\n\nWhen and how does one take an exit call?\n\n\nIf we look at the above and some other under performing examples, a number of scenarios emerge when one has to take an exit call. The erosion of cash flow visibility is is one of the prime reasons for the under performance of any business. If the business conditions change and the business is not able to generate cash flows in an expected time frame, then it would be very difficult to get returns from such business models. \n\n\n\nIn the Indian context, over the past few years, some of the companies that own infrastructure assets have fallen in this category resulting in a sharp under performance.\n\n\n\n\nMy Key Takeaways\n\n\n•The\nbest sell decision is the one which you have thought at the time of buying that\nstock.\n•When\nyour own original hypothesis no longer hold true. The position is breaking your\nallocation rules.\n•There\nis a change in management , and you are not comfortable with.\n•Promises\nv/s delivery \n•Cash\ncalls due to market , sell % of all holding\n•Business\nhas undergone a huge change. \n•When\nyou have something in your portfolio and it doesn’t work as you thought for 1\nyear then sell.\n        Many of you must be thinking that how can selling be Science ? So answer to your doubt is anything that follows a process backed by theory is called as science. We all know the answer for Why selling is an Art but hardly we conclude that Selling is an Art and Science both together. If we understand the depth selling requires a right procedure to be followed every time. Selling requires your thesis and every new experiment brings out the new rule.\nSources: kiplinger\n                ForbesIndia\n                Stallwart Advisors\n                Seeking Alpha\n               Economic Times\n               ChartyourTrade\n               Morning Star\n               Oldschoolvalue\n\nDisclaimer: I’ve tried to note down my key learning\nfrom all the publicly available reports. \nThis\nis just a compilation of few thoughts that I picked up.

We are operating in one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies and businesses are nowhere close to saturation. For us, a 5% or 6% growth is a slowdown. We have a lot of growth to see and our businesses have very long runways of future growth ahead. Businesses that can deliver growth without stretching balance sheets and without taking in more capital (through the issuance of new equity shares) and where the quality of growth is excellent in terms of incremental returns on capital—they will increase per share value for stock holders over the long term.&nbsp;</font></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\"><font face=\"georgia\" size=\"2\" style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">That potential growth in value is sometimes mispriced by markets even if the stock has appreciated a lot already.

With ‘dead money’ it is probably best to sell one-third, maybe even half the holding rather than the entire position simply because such stocks occasionally experience incredibly short, sharp rebounds.

One needs the right dosage of detachment, but then one also needs to be very much attached to the right kinds of businesses and people who run them. The first thing to ask is whether the business is delivering what you envisaged. By and large, is the business is delivering performance in line with your long-term projections? Some slippages must be tolerated.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\">Some mis-allocation of capital decisions must be tolerated. It’s important to not measure this performance every quarter. Just because the information is available, you don’t have to use it. Imagine if companies were required to provide monthly performance, not just quarterly. How important would those numbers be? More data does not result in more insights. Often, it results in bad judgments. Equally important is to determine whether or not that performance is coming from variables envisaged and not some other factor.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\">If the answer to that is overwhelmingly yes, then you could get pleasantly surprised as great businesses tend to do better than earlier envisaged. So, to help determine if you should hold or sell a business that’s really working for you, use what I call as&nbsp;blue sky scenario. Basically, it means that you should not use the same assumptions you used when you bought the stock. This is especially true when the business you bought into is doing far better than you had anticipated.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\">If you bought the right type of business, then there is likely to be tendency for it to deliver&nbsp;better&nbsp;than what you envisaged. If you see that tendency play out after you have invested, don’t&nbsp;ruin&nbsp;it by staying with the original model. Your model has to be adaptive. If the performance is far better (or worse) than you envisaged, you have to change the model unless the improvement (or deterioration is likely to be temporary).</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: georgia; font-size: small; line-height: 1.5; text-align: start;\"><br /></span></div><div style=\"line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify;\"><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-size: 12px;\"><font face=\"georgia\">Is investing in equities only about buying good stocks?
