Neogen Chemicals Limited (Neogen) reported robust financial performance during the
quarter ended 30th June, 2022. The Company delivered revenues of Rs. 147.9 crore in Q1
FY23, depicting a growth of 75%. The strong topline performance was driven by incremental
benefits accruing from the expanded capacity. This was supported by continued positive
demand across key products.


Profit after tax (PAT) stood at Rs. 11.1 crore during the quarter as compared to Rs. 7.4 crore
in Q1 FY22. Strong double-digit growth in PAT was aided by good operating performance.


During the period under review, the Company witnessed significant increase in the prices
of Lithium raw materials which Company was able to pass on to the customers, resultantly
protecting the absolute EBITDA. The EBITDA percentage margin decline is optical as it
considers higher revenues and higher RM costs with preserved absolute earnings.


Neogen Chemical Investor Presentation
Developments 
An estimated capital expenditure of upto Rs. 150 crore
has been planned – this will be deployed in FY23 at Dahej SEZ Plant for: 
• Expanding manufacturing capacity of specialty organic chemicals by
60,000 litres – to support new molecules developed in-house and enhancing
ability to do multiple chemistries.
• Increasing the capacity for manufacturing inorganic salts from 1,200 MT
to 2,400 MT in existing Inorganic MPP – this is to cater to demand from
new approvals received from international customers for regular lithium based products recently and expected growth in their demand in domestic
market. 
• Setting up new capacity in existing Inorganic MPP for 400 MTPA for
manufacturing Specialty Lithium Salts and additives for Electrolyte used
in Lithium-Ion batteries advance chemistry cells – targeted for trial
approvals in international markets and captive consumption for
manufacturing of electrolyte.

Increase
demand for Dietary Supplements and Nutraceuticals
India might be a late entrant in the health supplement game,
but COVID-19 has brought a renewed focus on healthy lifestyle habits and diet,
which is expected to further boost the adoption of preventive healthcare
solutions. 

The growing social media penetration and vernacular content
platforms have also broadened the healthcare horizon for Indians. In the end, a
win-win for all - For companies, this segment provides a great combination of

franchise. Consumers benefit from better health and living, and society in
general from a reduced healthcare burden.


Dietary supplements
Dietary supplements are products taken in addition
to a healthy diet to provide additional health benefits, such as additional
nutrients. A dietary supplement is a product designed to complement the
diet and contains one or more of the following nutritious elements, (DSHEA)
according to the Dietary Supplement Health.
Supplements consist of herb, mineral, vitamin,s or other
botanical, amino acids, as well as their concentrations, components, extracts,
or metabolites. Dietary processing includes intake, digestion, absorption,
distribution, and excretion of food and beverages.

Nutraceuticals
A nutraceutical is a substance that is regarded as a food or a
portion of a food that, in addition to its regular nutritional content,
provides health advantages such as disease prevention or promotion is any
non-toxic dietary component that has been proven to be beneficial to one's
health in a scientific study. It includes disease treatment or prevention. The
functional component of the food must be standardized and manufactured in the
nutraceutical product.

Key
Drivers for the growth

Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


Need for Edtechs
In a dramatic shift from the age of gurukuls, the foundation
of modern education in India was laid under the British Raj, which led to
today’s formal, multiple-layered education structure divided between primary
and secondary schools, to graduation, post-graduation, diploma, and distance
education courses. While schools are governed by education boards such as the
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of
Secondary Education (ICSE), institutions providing higher education are
governed by statutory bodies such as the Medical Council of India (MCI), the All-India
Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and The Bar Council of India (BCI).

Over the course of time, the informal structure of education
has developed its roots parallelly with the formal system. This includes
one-on-one tuitions, coaching classes, vocational courses, and technology-based
solutions to aid, supplement and replace the traditional modes of education.
With the rise of start-ups and technology in India, entrepreneurs in this
segment have come across several gaps and pioneered new-age education with
modern business models.

In FY19, the size of India’s education sector stood
at $101 Bn, and its online education market at $563 Mn. To put it into
perspective, the country’s online education system comprised a mere 0.56% of
the overall education sector. India was ranked 28th among 88 countries in the
English Proficiency Index 2018, highlighting the country’s position considering
a large English-speaking population allows easy delivery of educational
products.



Reasons for growth 
Edtech startups are gaining popularity as coaching for
competitive examinations is becoming more affordable. Considering that more
than 15 Mn students in India prepare for competitive exams, there is a vast
market for edtech startups. Students are today facing rising competition for
exploring opportunities in the fields of engineering and medicine (at the K-12
stage), securing government- and public-sector jobs such as Short-Service
Commission (SSC) and Bank Probationary Officer (PO) respectively, and cracking
Common Admission Test (CAT) to take up management studies. 

Edtech start-ups today run on lower costs and bandwidth and
are more technology-driven compared to traditional brick-and-mortar coaching
centers. For these very factors, these start-ups are popular in Tier II and
Tier III cities, despite a lack of access to more skilled teachers as in their
Tier I peers. 

Many brick-and-mortar coaching institutes too are offering
app- and web-based solutions in addition to core services to increase their
online footprint. The presence of tech companies such as Telegram and Amazon
India (Exam Central Book Store) in this area makes the opportunity in the
segment even more appealing for edtech start-ups.

Online Education Spearheading the Edtech Revolution In India
By 2021 the online education market in India is estimated to be worth $2 Bn.




Capital Inflow Reached Historical Peak In 2019 Without
outliers, the total funding amount surged 2x in 2019 ($283 Mn) compared to $140
Mn in 2018

Key Trends 
·     $433 Mn total funding poured into ed-tech startups
in 2019 was 36% lower compared to $681 Mn in 2018.

·     Both the number of funding deals and count of
unique startups funded plunged by 15% and 4% respectively in 2019 compared to
the previous year.

·      The average ticket size of the funding amount in
2019 was $11 Mn compared to $17 Mn in 2018.

·      BYJU’s was the top-funded ed-tech startup in
India for 5 years straight (2015-2019) 79% was the contribution of BYJU’s in the total capital inflow of ed-tech startups for the year 2018.





Increase in number of Ed techs
The $10 Bn Edtech Opportunity by 2025 – Low cost and ease
will be driving factors for mass adoption of online education in India.


Government initiatives driving the Indian EdTech industry
The Indian EdTech industry is expected to be more policy-friendly in the upcoming years due to rising government interest. The National
Education Policy 2020 emphasized the importance of leveraging technology in
education solutions and supported the creation of learning content in regional
languages, calling it a high priority.

Increase in Internet Penetration
According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
2020, smartphone ownership among government school student families increased
from 30% in 2018 to 56% in 2020, whereas smartphone ownership among private school student families rose
from 50% to 74%.



Due to the global pandemic, schools and universities across
countries have switched to digital or online models to allow students to
continue their learning. This has potentially disrupted the well-established
models in school (K-12) education and university formats permanently.


The popularity of tech-enabled learning solutions in the
Indian education system is only going to accelerate further as educational
institutions, teachers, parents and governments become increasingly willing to
adopt the technology. The sector is likely to witness heightened activity in
innovation, new ventures, investments, and mergers & acquisitions (M&As)
in the future.


The only listed player in Edtechs is NIIT. Established in 1981, NIIT, a leading global talent development corporation that is engaged in building skilled human capital and enhancing workforce talent worldwide. With a presence in over 30 countries, the company offers training and development solutions to enterprises and individuals through CLG and SNC businesses.

"Ethanol - Demand, Market Size, Opportunities & New Goverment Policies (Part-2)",https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/05/ethanol-industry-insights-part-2.html,2022-05-07T13:01:00.003Z,2022-05-07T13:01:00.003Z,Unknown,"Ethanol production capacities, impact on Farmers, and Government Plans


Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


Ethanol was rarely discussed in the country about 7-8 years
ago. But now ethanol has become one of the major priorities of 21st century
India. The focus on ethanol is having a better impact on the environment as
well as on the lives of farmers.

India’s requirement of ethanol for petrol blending will
increase from 173 crore liters in 2019-20 to 1,016 crore liters in 2025-26. To
enable the rollout of ethanol production across India, ethanol may be supplied
from surplus to deficit states based on the requirements to ensure uniform
availability of ethanol blends in the country.

To achieve the Modi Administration’s E-20 blending goal by
ethanol supply year (ESY) (December-November) 2025, India would need to procure
approximately 11 billion liters (BL) of ethanol for blending with petroleum. As
of November 2021, India’s concentrated ethanol production capacity totaled
slightly above 6 billion liters. Of that amount, approximately 5.25 BL (88%
share) is ascribed to distillation units (projects) that use sugar and
molasses feedstocks. Conversely, the current grain-based (e.g., corn) distillation
capacity consists of 750 million liters. 

To address the production gap, the government has looked to
increase India’s grain-based ethanol unit capacity by 5-5.5 billion liters.

Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to notify a plan for
availability of E10 fuel (blend of 10% ethanol and 90% petrol) by April 2022.
Further, the Ministry is to notify a plan for the continued availability of fuel for older vehicles. Fuel blended with 20% ethanol (E20) should be launched
in a phased manner from April 2023 to ensure the availability of E20 by 2025.
The rollout of higher ethanol blends may be done in a phased manner, starting
with the states with surplus production of ethanol.


The process to procure Ethanol



Increase in Production Capacity
State Production Capacity The number of new grain-based
ethanol projects varies by state. At present, Punjab has 16 grain-based ethanol
plants, the largest amount, with an installed capacity of 620 million liters.
Since January 2021, roughly 35 projects have been approved in Maharashtra which
would increase the state’s annual capacity by 1.07 BL, according to Post
sources. 

Additionally, 29 projects were approved in Uttar Pradesh
with an additional estimated annual capacity of 1.08 BL, while 20 new projects
totaling 1.02 BL of potential capacity were approved in Chhattisgarh. An
additional 26 various projects are approved throughout Bihar, Odisha, and West
Bengal. To achieve the estimated 8.59 BL of ethanol produced annually through
the new plants, India would need to balance interests in procuring additional
surplus grain stocks for fuel against feed/human consumption.

India currently has 113 grain-based distilleries
(Table 1) with a cumulative annual capacity of 2.58 billion liters (Table 1).
More than half of these units produce potable liquor (i.e., spirits), which is
also among the top tax revenue streams for state governments across India.




Boost farmer’s Income
Remunerative prices of ethanol to suppliers have more than
doubled in the last six years-a major boost to farmers’ income. An eight-fold jump
in procurement in the last six years and the price of procurement going up by
nearly 2.5 times, has led to a significant jump in the income of farmers.


Ethanol supplies and blending percentages have increased more
than five times in the last six years. While 38 crore liters of Ethanol were
procured during the year 2013-14, in 2020-21 this jumped nearly eight times to
322 crore liters.


Ethanol distillation capacities have almost doubled, and the number of distilleries increased by 40% in five years. The decision to
allow diversion of B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup for
ethanol production in 2018-19 enabled a reliable supply of feedstock and the
price stability of sugar.

There are measures taken to expedite regulatory
clearances for ethanol production such as expediting the issuing of consent to
establish distilleries by state governments. Further, a single-window system
may be formulated by the Department
for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to facilitate speedy clearances
for new projects and expansion of current projects for ethanol production.

Chambal Fertilizer - The largest player in the urea industry in India,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/04/chambal-fertilizer-largest-private.html,2022-04-03T06:54:00.002Z,2022-04-03T06:54:00.002Z,Unknown,"Chambal Fertilizers - Company overview & Urea industry synopsis in India
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


Company Overview 
Incorporated
in 1985 and based in Kota, Rajasthan, Chambal has the largest installed urea
capacity of 3.00 million tonnes in the private sector in India. Chambal is the
largest private player in the urea industry in India in terms of production
capacity. Its share in the total domestic urea production has increased to
13.4%, driven by the ramp-up of its Gadepan-III plant. The company has maintained
its share in the non-urea fertilizers segment.


The company has sold 0.93 million tonnes of DAP/muriate of potash/nitrogen phosphorus
potassium during the first 9 months of fiscal 2022, down from 1.60 million
tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal because of the global
shortage of the fertilizers amidst the Russia-Ukraine war. Its significant
market share in north India is supported by its strong Uttam Vir brand and
robust distribution network. The company also trades in complex fertilizers and
pesticides. The urea plants are near the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur gas
pipeline, which ensures sufficient gas availability.


The Company has 3 manufacturing plants with an annual production capacity of around 3.4 million MT of Urea. All the three Urea
manufacturing plants of the Company are located at Gadepan, District Kota,
Rajasthan, which is the largest single location Urea manufacturing facility in
India.


Revenue
trend past 5 years




Urea growth potential
The
consumption of Urea is the highest among all the fertilizers used in India. Urea
is the most important crop nutrient which plays a vital role in ensuring food
security in the country. The Urea industry comprises manufacturers from the public, co-operative and private sectors. The Urea manufactured in the country
is not sufficient to meet its total demand. Hence, part of the demand for Urea
is met through imports. 



The price of Urea is controlled by the
Government of India. The subsidized price at which the Urea is to be sold to the
farmers by the manufacturers is decided by the Government of India and it pays
subsidies to the manufacturers based on the applicable policy parameters. Natural
gas is the main input for the manufacture of Urea. The cost of natural gas is
considered appropriate by the Government of India when determining subsidy
on Urea payable to the manufacturing units. Hence, the fluctuation in prices of
natural gas does not have much impact on the Urea manufacturing units.



Other
Products 
The Company strives to provide all agri-inputs
under one roof to farmers. Apart from manufacturing Urea, the Company markets
other fertilizers and agri-inputs such as Di- Ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Muriate
of Potash (MOP), and Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS), different grades of NPK fertilizers,
Sulphur, micro-nutrients, and agrochemicals.



The company has an established market position and superior operating efficiency of its
fertilizer plants. Operating performance remains comfortable, with plants
operating at over 100% utilization and within the prescribed energy norms. The profitability of the urea division will remain immune to the rise in feedstock
(natural gas) prices as this is compensated through subsidy receipts from the
government. The global shortage of complex fertilizers, which has led to a
spike in their prices, could affect profitability in the medium term.


Profit
margin growth trend


Government
subsidies to boost the growth
DAP,
MOP, APS and NPK fertilizers are covered under the Nutrient Based Subsidy
(“NBS”) policy of the Government of India. The subsidy on these products is
paid by the Government of India to the Company based on the different nutrients
in these fertilizers and the Company determines the sale prices of these
products as per NBS. In view of this, the prices of these products are guided
by market forces. DAP, APS, and NPK fertilizers are manufactured in the
country as well as imported by various players. 



While
there has been an unprecedented rise in raw material prices (especially pooled
gas prices) and imported fertilizer rates, the additional subsidies (Rs 60,593
crore added to the initial budget of Rs 79,530 crore) announced by the
government should restrict the increase in subsidy arrears for this fiscal. A
similar addition in the subsidy budget is expected for fiscal 2023, to compensate
for the rise in raw material and imported fertilizer prices. Timely
announcement and disbursement of the additional subsidies remain key rating
sensitivity factors.



High
dependence on imports
MOP
is not produced in India and the country is fully dependent on imports. The
Company imports these fertilizers from international manufacturers and
producers and sells them in its marketing territory under its brands. 



The
production and imports of these products vary due to factors such as demand,
pipeline inventories, pricing of the products in the international market, cost
of raw material, etc. Sulphur and micronutrients are purchased from
manufacturers in India and imported from international manufacturers. In the case
of agrochemicals, the technical grade agrochemicals are produced by
multinational companies as well as domestic producers. 



Chambal
sold 2.62 million tonnes of urea and 0.93 million tonnes of DAP/muriate of
potash/nitrogen phosphorus potassium during the first nine months of fiscal
2022 (2.73 million tonnes and 1.60 million tonnes, respectively, in the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal). While the uneven distribution of
rainfall caused a marginal decline in urea sales, the global shortage of
complex fertilizers impacted sales volume in the domestic market.



Points
to concern
Further,
the Urea manufactured by the Company is preferred by the customers in its
marketing territory due to its good product quality and strong brand image of the
Company. Hence, the Company does not foresee much impact on its business due to
the capacity addition by new players in the Urea sector. The demand variation due
to changes in monsoon pattern, volatility in the prices of DAP, MOP, APS, and NPK
fertilizers, and variation in the foreign exchange rates are a few challenges
that the Company faces in its business related to non-Urea fertilizers. The
Company continuously evaluates these factors and strives to mitigate them
through dynamic sourcing and pricing of the products and appropriate hedging of
foreign exchange risk.



Roadmap
ahead
The
recent rise in feedstock (natural gas) prices will not impact the operating
profitability of the urea production division as it is passed through entirely,
to be compensated through subsidy receipts from the government. For
Profitability against production above-reassessed capacity, wherein the incentive
is capped at import parity price of urea plus incidental charges, to also not
be majorly impacted on considering that the imported urea prices are also high.
However, the global shortage of complex fertilizers, which has led to a spike
in prices, may have a mid-term impact on overall profitability.



Gadepan-III
plant has enabled the Company to increase its market share in Urea and thus
enhanced its competitive strength due to more efficient operations on account
of economies of scale. After the commissioning of the Gadepan-III plant, the Company
has started focusing on strengthening its reach in existing marketing
territories and expanding in new geographies in the eastern, western, and southern
parts of India through a concerted brand-building approach.



A
few more plants are expected to be operational to increase the indigenous
supply of Urea during the next 1-2 years which shall reduce the demand-supply gap
in the country. However, these plants are in eastern and southern parts of India
whereas the core marketing territory of the Company is the Northern and Central
parts of India. 


The Company has an established brand and sizeable market share in the DAP and MOP fertilizers and making inroads in the NPK fertilizers space. The Company plans to replicate its success in the existing marketing territory in new marketing territories and increase its reach in the existing marketing territories which offers an opportunity for the Company to enhance its sales volumes and market share.

Top 5 trends that will boost the Healthcare sector,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/03/top-5-trends-that-will-boost-healthcare.html,2022-03-13T09:44:00.004Z,2022-03-13T09:44:00.004Z,Unknown,"Trends to track in Healthcare Sector


Wherever we look in the healthcare industry, we can find new
technology being used to fight illness, develop new vaccines and medicines, and
help people to live healthier lives.

It is apparent that some pharmaceutical companies are
starting to recognize the impact of the two major shifts: Downward pressure on
pricing and the move towards prevention, diagnosis, and real cures. These
changes are upsetting the established order, opening the door to new
competition, and forcing companies to rethink where they play – and who they
play with, requiring a growing emphasis on collaboration and partnership.

Over the last two years, many tech companies have focused on
applying their expertise to solve problems caused by the global pandemic. At
the same time, many healthcare companies that would not necessarily have
traditionally been considered tech companies have turned their attention to
technology and its potential to transform the delivery of their products and
services.

It's clear that the pandemic has accelerated the
digitization of the healthcare industry. According to the HIMSS Future of
Healthcare Report, 80% of healthcare providers plan to increase investment in
technology and digital solutions over the next five years. We will continue to
see growth in areas including telemedicine, personalized medicine, genomics,
and wearables, with organizers leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), cloud
computing, extender reality (XR), and the internet of things (IoT) to develop
and deliver new treatments and services.



Top 5 trends that will boost the growth of the Healthcare
sector



From drug discovery and development to medical imaging and
patient engagement, artificial intelligence occupies a prominent position in
the industry. Along with big data and analytics, more than a third of pharma
startups are working on software solutions for the industry. 

There is still a lack of access to basic medicines in many
regions of the world, prompting demand for flexible pharmaceutical
manufacturing. The use of real-world data to collect accurate patient
experiences, blockchain to securely transact and manage patient records, and
augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR & MR) solutions also find a
place in the top 10 pharma industry trends. However, these trends cover only a
small fraction of the breadth of innovation in the industry. Based on your
specific criteria, your top trends can look quite different.

1. Remote healthcare and telemedicine
Even when COVID goes, telemedicine is here to stay. Doctors
in India were stymied by the lack of clarity – whether I can, or I cannot, and
if they would be taken to the court. But on 25 March 2020, the Medical Council
of India amended the ethics part of the rules and the telemedicine practice
guidelines were issued – it has certain lacunas, but I am sure they will get
better over time. But I think the dissemination of the knowledge that telemedicine
is legal has not reached the nth degree. So its potential is not being fully
harnessed. But over time telemedicine consults will become a regularity.



The reasons for this increase are obvious – but even when we
take communicable diseases out of the equation, there are plenty of good
reasons to develop capabilities to examine, diagnose and treat patients
remotely. In remote regions and places where there are shortages of doctors
(such as China and India) this trend has the potential to save lives by
dramatically expanding access to medical treatment.

2. Making sense of medical data with AI and machine learning
The high-level use case for AI in healthcare, as in other
sectors, is in helping to make sense of the huge amount of messy, unstructured
data that’s available for capture and analysis. In healthcare, this can take
the form of medical image data – X-rays, CT and MRI scans, as well as many
other sources, including information on the spread of communicable diseases
like covid, the distribution of vaccines, genomic data from living cells, and
even handwritten doctors' notes.


Digital twins are quickly becoming popular in many
industries, in a trend that involves creating models informed by real-world
data that can be used to simulate any system or process.

In healthcare, this trend encompasses the idea of the
virtual patient – digital simulations of people that are used to test drugs and
treatments, with the aim of reducing the time it takes to get new medicines
from the design stage into general use. Initially, this may be confined to
models or simulations of individual organs or systems. However, progress is
being made towards useful models that simulate entire bodies. Current research
suggests this is still some way from being a realistic possibility, but during
2022 we will continue to see progress towards this goal.

Shift in trends – for better future        
An increasing number of pharmaceutical firms – and, indeed,
medical device companies – are partnering and integrating with technology
businesses. In a bid to tackle the huge and rising blight of diabetes, Sanofi
and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet, announced in
September 2016 that they would invest approximately US$500 million in a joint
venture to combine devices, software, and medicine.

We believe medical device companies are leading the
cooperation with tech companies. For example, in the diabetes space, one
interesting partnership involves device giant Medtronic teaming up with tech
firm Qualcomm, to develop a continuous glucose monitoring system that will also
provide actionable insights to patients and providers.

Software is becoming more and more important in our lives,
and healthcare is no exception. Another pharma tech alliance between Varian
Medical Systems and Flatiron Health aims to develop cloud-based, electronic
health records, data analytics, and decision support software geared toward
oncology patients.

3. Nutraceuticals are the gem of healthcare
In the vitamins and nutrients market, the top five
categories constitute ~85% share. Increasing focus on prevention, self-care,
health and wellness, and awareness about the importance of high immunity is
leading to increased consumption of vitamin and mineral supplements and other
nutraceutical products.





4. Biosimilars
New chemical entities (NCEs) and new biological
entities (NBEs) These products are the major focus for leading multinational
pharma companies. Indian companies are beginning to improve their in-house
novel drug development with the aim of launching new blockbusters. Developing
NCEs and NBEs put Indian companies in direct competition with global
innovators. Some of the large Indian pharma companies, such as Zydus, Glenmark,
and Sun, as well as clinical research organizations (CROs) and contract
development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), are already engaged in
researching new drugs.




In 2013, Zydus became the first Indian company to launch an
indigenously developed NCE, Lipaglyn (saroglitazar), the world’s first glitazar
treatment for diabetic dyslipidemia or hypertriglyceridemia in Type II
diabetes, not controlled by statins alone. The drug was recently approved as
the first drug for the treatment of Non-Cirrhotic and Non-Alcoholic
Steatohepatitis (NASH) in India (March 2020). 

The second phase of development in the US is expected to
get approval in 2027. Biocon was the first company to launch indigenously
developed novel biologics in India. The company launched BIOMab EGFR for head
and neck cancer treatment in 2006, and Alzumab (itolizumab) for psoriasis
treatment in 2013. Both these novel monoclonal antibodies have been launched in
several countries in collaboration with global companies.



5. Rise in E-pharmacies/ E- Prescriptions
E-pharmacy holds the potential to improve the accessibility of
medicine to even the remotest corners of the country. The first online pharmacy
was started in the US in the late 1990s. In India, the e-pharmacy space is still at
a nascent stage. The market was estimated at US$0.5b in 201954 with companies
such as NetMeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, and 1mg dominating the market. It is
projected to reach US$4.5b in 2025 at a CAGR of 44% for the period 2019—2025,
representing about 10%-12% of the pharmaceutical sales (up from 2%-3% levels in
2019).

India’s drug prices are among the lowest in the world.
However, they are still out of reach for a large percentage of the population
due to high out-of-pocket expenditure. To tackle affordability issues, price
control mechanisms have been in place since 1955 when the government first
imposed price ceilings under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. 

Many of the developments in the pharmaceutical industry
mirror those in the automotive sector. Like pharmaceuticals, the industry is
relatively mature and made up of a few major players. And automakers also face
intense pressure from regulators – in their case to cut emissions, accelerating
the move toward electric and other non-polluting vehicles. The growing
dependence upon technology, primarily software, is attracting the interest of
new entrants such as Google, Uber, and Tesla who are focusing on mobility,
rather than on the automotive industry itself.

Pharmaceutical companies that manage to embrace the most
appropriate archetypes, and master disruption, have the greatest chance to
deliver real value.

Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar
The Indian
economy has transformed substantially, from being a ship-to-mouth economy since
its independence to become one of the largest economies in the world.
Agriculture continues to be a dominant element in the Indian economy. Along
with major economic reforms, Government programs, such as the Green
Revolution have played a critical role in transforming the country’s
agriculture sector and paved the way towards economic growth of the country. 


Agrochemicals
specifically have played an important role in preventing crop losses to pests
and improving overall productivity. Proper and scientific usage of
agrochemicals may lead to approximately 20–30% improvement in productivity.
Currently, the usage of agrochemicals in the Indian agriculture sector is amongst
the lowest in the world.


India is one of
the leading producers in the world. Be it food grains, horticulture crops,
oilseed production, Agricultural exports, or FDI in the domain, all have
flourished over the past few decades.


Top countries by
pesticide use (000' tonnes)



Europe and
Asia-Pacific are the highest consumers of agrochemicals and account for around
half of the global consumption. These regions also account for around 85% of
the agrochemical exports around the world, making them the global manufacturing
and exports hub. Agrochemical consumption around the world has transformed
agriculture and has helped in achieving substantial gains in yields of many
agricultural crops. A study in 2013 estimated that pests can cause a yield loss
of as much as 28.2% in wheat, 31.2% in maize, and 28.8% in cotton. Therefore, there
is a direct relation between pesticide usage and agricultural production.


With an
estimated crop loss of above 2 trillion INR per annum due to pests, coupled
with a very low level of pesticides usage of 340 g/ha (compared to most developing
agriculture economies), there is a strong role that agrochemicals can play in
protecting food sufficiency and quality of agricultural produce in India, with
very favorable cost-benefit ratio.





Usage of
agrochemicals along with other high-quality agri-inputs has been instrumental
in improving agricultural production and productivity around the world.
However, there are disparities when it comes to the productivity of major food
crops amongst countries.


Although the
disparities can be contributed by many factors, such as the extent of agri-input
usage, availability of resources, agro-climatic conditions, and markets, it is
safe to assume that higher but correct pesticide usage can lead to substantial
improvements in yield. The below infographic illustrates a comparison of yields of
major food crops in India with major food-producing countries.


India is the
fifth largest producer and the fourth largest exporter of agrochemicals. The
Indian agrochemicals industry was valued at around INR 42,000 crore in FY20 out
of which domestic consumption was worth around INR 20,000 crore, while exports
during the same period were worth around INR 22,000 crore. The industry is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 8–10% till 2025 and the growth is expected to be
driven by several growth levers like increasing population, decreasing arable
land, increasing demand for high-value agricultural products, and increasing
efforts from the industry and the Government to promote awareness and
technology penetration.


The following table highlights the subsegments and user industries wherein specialty chemicals find a large range of applications: 





Important trends drive the Indian Agrochemical sector. 
The following pointers highlight the current and upcoming trends in the agrochemical
industries
•Increasing focus towards digital avenues has improved decision
making and enhanced traceability across the value chain
•Evolving models like direct selling through FPOs and
direct-to-consumer (D2C) platforms like e-commerce are impacting the entire
ecosystem of agrochemicals in India
•Increasing focus on diversification into specialty nutrients
products such as biofertilizers, bio-stimulants, micronutrients, and organic
products has picked up across the industry. These segments have seen multiple
investments in a bid to develop innovative and cost-effective products for
farmers.
•Monetization of farming services such as spraying of
agrochemicals and direct-to-farm delivery of agri-inputs are changing the
landscape of the industry. Various start-ups have come up in the domain and
have been trying to capitalize on the existing market demand.
•Increasing interest of farmers towards solutions like ‘product as
a service, mobile app-based advisory, market information, etc. have enabled
quick dissemination of information enabling better decision making from
farmers. This is also expected to drive farm productivity, profitability, and higher risk-adjusted returns for farmers.
•Specialty
chemicals have come up as an attractive emerging area that has witnessed
strong growth, new investments, and capability enhancement among Indian
Agrochemical players. Their application in a variety of end-user industries makes
these even more suitable for agrochemical companies as a product offering. 
 
It’s
time to create a 360-degree buzz about the role of agrochemicals in Indian
agriculture and their importance in ensuring food and nutrition security.
Government and industries should work together, 
review existing regulatory and policy hassles right from production to
end consumers, and make a robust plan towards the theme of ""Make in
India and Make for the World."" Insecticides
dominate the Indian crop protection market however Herbicides are emerging as
the fastest-growing segment.

Production,
Export, and Imports of agrochemicals (Unit: 000 tonnes)





Production of
agrochemicals (technical grade) has grown by 11.9% during 9M-FY21. Despite the
impact of the coronavirus on the domestic market two consecutive good monsoon
seasons, the vibrancy of the rural markets, and a good sowing season have attributed
to an increase in production. New product launches, pro-active raw material planning
along efficient capacity utilization have also supported the increase in
manufacturing. An increase in manufacturing of technical augurs well for the
industry as it is getting more backward integrated.








During the budget announcement, the government also increased the credit for farmers increased from Rs. 15 lakh crores to Rs. 16.5 lakhs crores and decided to further add 1,000 mandies through the eNam platform which is to give benefit to the farmers to sell his crops at better prices which will ultimately improve the profitability of the farming community.


Going forward,
with acreage and crop prices both improving, the sector is structurally
well-placed also considering the fact that this year’s harvest is slated
to be a bumper crop and the farming community will be having good liquidity to
spend money to safeguard their crop from pests and diseases.

Healthcare Global Enterprise Ltd. -  Company Overview,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2022/02/healthcare-global-enterprise-ltd.html,2022-02-12T08:11:00.001Z,2022-02-12T08:11:00.001Z,Unknown,"Healthcare Global Enterprise Ltd. -  India's Leading Oncology Focused Network


Background
Established
in 1989, Healthcare Global Enterprises Limited (HCG), is present primarily in
the oncology field with the largest cancer care network (with 22 cancer care
centers as of December 2021) and three multi-specialty hospitals. It is
promoted by Dr. B.S. Ajai Kumar, practicing radiation and medical oncologist
with over 30 years of experience.



Originally
established with a single cancer care center, the Bangalore Institute of
Oncology (BIO), at Bangalore by Dr. B.S. Ajai Kumar and four other oncologists,
the company has rapidly expanded its presence to Ahmedabad, Chennai, Nasik,
Ranchi, Rajkot, Cuttack, Hubli, Mumbai, Nagpur, Vizag, and Vijayawada, among
others. The company is now present across the oncology value chain, offering
services from prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment to rehabilitation,
supportive care, and palliative care. 


Pursuant
to the Investment Agreement entered by the company and promoter with Aceso Company
Pte Ltd (CVC group) in June 2020 and subsequent equity infusion, a majority
stake of 56.8% (on a fully diluted basis) is now held by the CVC Group.
Established in 1981, CVC is a private equity and investment advisory firm with
US$ 114.8 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2021. It has a
global network of 24 local offices - 16 across Europe and America and eight in
the Asia Pacific region. 



Business Overview


Strand
Divestment
HCG
announced the acquisition of oncology hospital labs and clinical trials
business from Strand Lifesciences as well as simultaneous divestment of its approx.38.5%
stake (on paid-up capital basis and 34.5% on a fully diluted basis) in Strand to
Reliance Industries group company. 



HCG
acquires majority stake in Suchirayu HealthCare Solutions
HealthCare
Global Enterprises Limited (HCG), the leading specialty healthcare service
provider in India focused on oncology, announced the acquisition of an
additional 60.9% in Suchirayu Healthcare Solutions (“Suchirayu” or “Company”),
Hubli, thereby becoming a majority stake owner from its existing 17.7% to
78.6%.
Suchirayu
owns a state-of-the-art multi-specialty hospital in Hubli with an operational
capacity of 110 beds and a potential to scale up to 250 beds.



Services
provided by HCG Cancer Care
Each
of its comprehensive cancer centers offers, at a single location, comprehensive
cancer diagnosis and treatment services (including radiation, medical oncology,
and surgical treatments). HCG’s freestanding diagnostic centers and its daycare chemotherapy center offer diagnosis and medical oncology services,
respectively. HCG has one of the lowest doctor-related expenses (~15% of
revenues) and the attrition rate is just ~5%.



Capex
phase to end between FY21 and FY23
HCG
was on a CAPEX overdrive between FY18 and FY20 when Rs 2,662 mn, Rs 2,199 mn, and Rs 2,141 mn were added to its gross tangible assets block in FY18, FY19, and
FY20 respectively. 9 new comprehensive cancer care centers were added between FY16
and FY20 which led to the decline in EBITDA margin and RoCE. HCG's new center
losses increased to Rs 455 mn in FY20 from around Rs 70 mn in FY17. While it
took about 1-1.5 years for the new centers to break even, Borivali and Nagpur
centers’ breakeven was delayed owing to the doctor and rent-related issues.


With
the commissioning of the South Mumbai center in Q3FY20, HCG is done with its
major CAPEX plan barring small amounts related to its Gurgaon comprehensive
cancer care center.



Capital Expenditure




De-leveraging balance sheet


Net debt reduced compared to June 2021
HCGs net debt on consolidated books reduced by Rs. 67 crores to Rs. 226.8 crore. The reduction was because of Rs. 8 crore-10 crore improvement in FCF and amount
raised through stake sale in Strand Life Sciences.


Revenue Snapshot for Q3FY22

improved digital traction driven by a continuous focus on strengthening clinical
talent. The company is looking to focus on market leadership in Bengaluru and
scaling up North India centers in the near term.







Management Comments

HCG's new patient
registration has almost doubled since 2018 and the company currently has above 100,000
new patients per annum which in turn has doubled the revenue in the said
period. The fact that 85% of this revenue is Oncology centric is a clear
testament to their business model in addition to the deep social impact that they make on the lives of thousands of patients and their families. Looking at the
future, management believes that this growth will enhance not only the back
of the increasing longevity of patients but also a realization that cancer is
now being viewed as a curable and chronic disease with a good lifestyle. 

With the addition of the labs and the clinical
trials business, the company is now uniquely positioned to not only enhance its
diagnostic capabilities and offerings but potentially redefine precision
medicine with end-to-end expertise spanning bioinformatics, genomics, and
research. With 25 hospitals, 21 of which are Oncology focused, HCG has built a
niche platform in the Indian healthcare space, and with their major CAPEX cycles
already done, management believes the future years will see the Company
benefiting from these investments.



This is the fourth consecutive quarter with all-time-record revenue
and the second consecutive quarter with all-time-record EBIDTA. Implementation of
go-to-market plans across their network locations during the last three quarters has
started showing results through this profitable growth. 

Overall, these results were made possible through the execution focus
and hard work of the entire HCG team, and they remain committed to driving growth
and optimizing operations in the coming quarters. For the future, they want to
build a long-term relationship with their patients to be their trusted advisors over
a lifetime. 

With
that objective in mind, they have begun their digital transformation journey to
create an Omnichannel end-to-end patient engagement platform with the help of
digital technology. Management believes that this initiative will accelerate its
growth in the future and help HCG to solidify its leadership position in oncology.

India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing emerging
economies over the last two decades, receiving large FDI inflows, which have
grown from USD 2.5 Billion in 2000-01 to USD 50 Billion in 2020-21. The
healthcare sector, in particular, has received heightened interest from
investors over the last few years.


In the hospital segment, the expansion of
private players to Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations, beyond metropolitan cities,
offers an attractive investment opportunity. According to Invest India’s
Investment Grid, there are nearly 600 investment opportunities worth USD 32
Billion (INR 2.3 Lakh Crore) in the country’s hospital/medical infrastructure
sub-sector.



Indian Government initiatives towards
development of hospital sector 
With respect to pharmaceuticals, India can boost domestic
manufacturing, supported by recent Government schemes with performance-linked
incentives, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India)
initiative. Further, between 2018 and 2024, patents worth USD 251 Billion are
expected to expire globally, presenting a lucrative opportunity for the
country’s pharmaceutical sector, including the patent market. In addition to
generic drugs, there are investment opportunities in other segments of India’s
pharmaceutical sector, including over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, and contract
manufacturing and research.


The hospital's industry is the largest segment of the
healthcare services in the country which has proliferated from primary
healthcare centers to single and multi-specialty corporate hospitals over the
years. The healthcare facilities are delivered to the population through public
and private routes which are explained below.



India’s healthcare industry comprises
hospitals, medical devices and equipment, health insurance, clinical trials,
telemedicine, and medical tourism. The medical devices and equipment segment,
expansion of diagnostic and pathology centers as well as miniaturized
diagnostics have a high potential for growth. Medical Value Travel, especially
wellness tourism, also has bright prospects, given India’s inherent strengths
in alternative systems of medicine.

Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY)
Mission Indradhanush

National Resource Centre for EHR Standards (NRCeS)

FDI in India’s Hospital Sector
India’s FDI regime has been liberalized extensively.
Currently, FDI is permitted up to 100% under the automatic route (i.e., the
non-resident investor or Indian company does not require approval from the
Government of India for the investment) in the hospital sector and in the
manufacture of medical devices. In the pharmaceutical sector,
FDI is permitted up to 100% in greenfield projects and 74% in brownfield
projects under the automatic route.


FDI beyond 74% in brownfield projects requires
approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Between April 2000-June
2020, India received USD 6.8 Billion in FDI in hospitals and diagnostic
centers. In the AYUSH sector as well,
100% FDI is permitted for the wellness and medical tourism segment.




Need for development Hospital Sector
India which accounts for nearly a fifth of the world’s
population has 12 beds per 10,000 people mainly in urban areas with the number
being far lower in rural areas. India’s bed density not only falls far behind
the global median of 29 beds, it also lags that of other developing countries
such as Brazil (21 beds), Malaysia (19 beds), and Vietnam (26 beds).



Despite the uptick in Government spending and thrust on
increasing insurance coverage, the Government of India’s expenditure on
healthcare stood only at 1.4% of GDP in FY18. The continuing disparity of
healthcare spending between urban and rural areas has resulted in a sharp disparity
in healthcare availability across the country. The Government of India is
planning to increase public health spending to 2.5% of the Country’s GDP by
2025.


The public healthcare facilities in India have been
unable to scale adequately to serve the needs of the large population reaching
the interiors of the country has been another challenge. Additionally, several
of these facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped in terms of basic
infrastructure and equipment, and in need of enhanced quality standards and
protocols. 


This unmet opportunity combined with strong fundamentals
has largely led to the private sector taking center stage in the healthcare landscape.
The late 1990s witnessed improvement in the economic conditions and made
private healthcare affordable to many Indians. These hospitals turned into
Centres of Excellence and over time, became the preferred choice for patients and
communities over Government hospitals.



Today, the healthcare
sector in India offers a potent mix of opportunities and challenges. The significant gap between ‘required’ and ‘actual’ healthcare infrastructure has
driven considerable investment over the years into assets like hospitals and
other facilities. Healthcare in India today provides corporations with a unique
opportunity for innovation, differentiation, and profits it has become a
preferred sector for strategic and financial investments.

What is Green Chemistry?
Green chemistry is an emerging focus among manufacturing
industries that minimizes pollution at a molecular level. Green chemistry is
the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use
or generation of hazardous substances. Companies are actively designing novel
concepts to reduce the emission of hazardous substances and actively switching their
production process to green chemistry.



The tremendous shift towards Green Chemistry
Green chemistry is an emerging focus among manufacturing
industries that minimizes pollution at a molecular level. The idea is that companies
can adopt new scientific processes to minimize the toll their products take on the environment. Companies are actively designing
novel concepts to reduce the emission of hazardous substances. The changes can be as
large as changing the entire chemistry or even as small as changing certain catalysts to reduce carbon footprints. Companies are actively switching their production process to
green chemistry.

Green chemistry is fundamentally trying to minimize the
impact on the environment from our chemistry. It also nicely combines with
economic benefits because the fewer materials you need, the less waste you
generate and the more cost-effective your production processes will be.

Biocatalysis allows chemists to use enzymes for
specific chemical reactions instead of rare and toxic transition metals. Green
chemistry has the unique benefit of being a win-win for both business and the
environment as mentioned in the table below, which is why the principles of
green chemistry extend far.






Why do we need to scale up action on green and
sustainable chemistry?
The number of chemicals is ever-increasing, and hazardous
chemicals and other pollutants continue to be released and disposed of in large
quantities, affecting individuals and communities worldwide. Synthetic
chemicals are now ubiquitous in humans and the environment. Chemical pollution has
become a major cause of human disease and premature death. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimated the burden of disease from selected chemicals at
1.6 million lives and 44.8 million disability-adjusted life years in 2016 which
is likely to be an underestimate.

India’s specialty chemical companies are gaining
favor with global multinational corporations because of the geopolitical shift after the  COVID-19  outbreak as the world looks to reduce its dependence on China.


The
world is seeking to address sustainability issues in terms of clean energy,
renewables, water waste, and overall waste reduction.






Indian government Initiatives to boost Green Chemistry
Indian government bodies such as the Department of Science
and Technology, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, and the Department
of Pharmaceuticals, are beginning to organize various GC initiatives including
partnering with SMEs to partially fund investments in green technology. 

Generic drug pharma and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
(“API”) manufacturers in India exhibit significant interest and some advances
in using GC principles. At the same time, 65% of Indian companies rely on
treatment and disposal of wastewater
instead of source reduction and one in
five (20%)  do not use any GC metrics.  The study found that generic pharma is more
advanced in adopting GC principles than API manufacturers. Regulatory risk and
time pressures to deliver drugs were reported as the two most significant barriers for greater
adoption of GC in India, while cost savings and environmental regulations were
cited as the top two drivers.

Green Chemistry in Pharmaceuticals
The pharmaceutical industry was among the first to embrace
Green Chemistry (“GC”) for its significant potential to reduce costs and risks.
Green pharmaceuticals as a segment are projected to grow to USD96.2 billion in
2026. The pharmaceutical industry is continually seeking ways to develop
medicines with less harmful side effects and using processes that produce less
toxic waste.

For example, Merck and Codexis developed a second-generation
green synthesis of sitagliptin, the active ingredient in JanuviaTM, a treatment
for type 2 diabetes. This collaboration leads to an enzymatic process that
reduces waste, improves yield and safety, and eliminates the need for a metal
catalyst. Early research suggests that the new biocatalysts will be useful in
manufacturing other drugs as well.

Green Chemistry in Paints
Oil-based ""alkyd"" paints give off large amounts of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These volatile compounds evaporate from the
paint as it dries and cures and many have one or more environmental impacts.

For example, Procter & Gamble and Cook Composites and
Polymers created a mixture of soya oil and sugar that replaces
fossil-fuel-derived paint resins and solvents, cutting hazardous volatiles by
50%. Chempol MPS paint formulations use these biobased Sefose oils to replace
petroleum-based solvents and create a paint that is safer to use and produces
less toxic waste.

Biodegradable Plastics

Several companies have been working to develop plastics that
are made from renewable, biodegradable sources. 

For example, NatureWorks of Minnetonka, Minnesota, makes
food containers from a polymer called polylactic acid branded as Ingeo. The
scientists at NatureWorks discovered a method where microorganisms convert
cornstarch into a resin that is just as strong as the rigid petroleum-based
plastic currently used for containers such as water bottles and yogurt pots.
The company is working toward sourcing raw materials from agricultural
waste.

As the name suggests, green chemistry reduces and to an
extent eliminates the production and use of hazardous substances in mining and
in the design, manufacture, and application of chemical products. It also
encourages energy savings and a better environment and health.

Bio-pulping process for Circular Economy
The circular economy is an appropriate way for the development of the pulp and paper industry which has intensive resources consumption and
environmental pollution. The concept of CE emphasizes the effective management of
resources from cradle to grave. As shown in straw was used as input in the bio-pulping process where the enzyme was used, and paper products were produced
after the thermal and mechanical processes. Then the pulp waste was utilized in the
production of biogas, or it can be burned for energy production. The generated
power and biogas can be applied to paper products again. The fly ash from
power plants can be effectively utilized as fertilizer for corps.



The market potential for green and sustainable chemistry
The evolution of green chemistry in the chemical industry
will be a critical trend fuelling the growth of the green chemicals market. The
global green chemicals market is expected to grow by USD 45 billion by 2025 at
a CAGR of 10.5% between 2019 and 2025.



Opportunities for green and sustainable chemistry
Recent innovations in chemistry and advanced materials have created new opportunities throughout the value chain to advance sustainability. These include, for example: revolutionizing energy storage and battery development; creating sustainable building materials improving the recyclability and biodegradability of several products, or turning carbon dioxide (CO2) and wastes into chemical feedstocks and valuable products.

Greener and more sustainable innovation at the interface of chemistry, biology, and clean science are particularly promising.

The Indian chemical industry is one of the fastest-growing
industries in the world. Currently, it ranks 3rd in Asia and is the 6th largest
market in the world with respect to output, after the US, China, Germany, Japan
and South Korea. The industry's growth is mainly driven by consumption growth
and export opportunity.

Demand for speciality chemicals is owing to their performance-enhancing applications instead of composition. Businesses operating in this
sector require deep knowledge and the ability to bring about consistent
innovations. The speciality chemicals industry is a mature sector with proven
benefits accruing to a wide range of end-use customers. It comprises about 17%
of the global chemicals market and is expected to grow at an average of 5.3%
between 2019 and 2024, picking up the pace on the back of emerging usage
applications in a variety of industrial sectors.

The speciality chemicals industry can be sub-divided based on
end-user industry into agrochemicals, dyes and pigments, personal care
ingredients, polymer additives, water chemicals, textile chemicals and
application-driven segments. These are the largest constituents of the
speciality chemicals industry and cumulatively constitute over 80% of the
speciality chemicals universe.




The
last two decades have seen a significant shift in the global speciality
chemicals industry with developed countries losing their production supremacy
(particularly the US) to emerging market nations in Asia. Key facilitators for
this shift include stricter environmental norms in western countries and cost
advantages enjoyed by emerging markets in terms of logistics and labour. Further,
companies wanted to shift closer to demand centres and optimize their supply
chains. The Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with a share of 48-50%, was the key
contributor to the global speciality chemicals market.





Indian speciality chemicals market to witness sharp growth
In terms of region-wise demand, India’s speciality chemicals
industry is expected to witness the growth of 10-12% CAGR between 2020 to 2025, due
to rising demand from end-user industries, coupled with tight global supply on
account of stringent environmental norms in China. Markets like the Americas,
Europe and Japan are expected to clock less than 3% CAGR over the next five
years, due to industry saturation in these regions. China’s speciality chemicals
industry, which saw historical growth rates of ~20% and above until 2013, is
expected to witness slower growth, of 4-6% CAGR, between 2020 to 2025, due to
various factors like environmental regulations, leading to an overall slowdown in
the industry.

At present, specific areas of usage include:
• Agriculture, requiring fertilizers and crop protection
applications
 • Electronics, needing agents to produce printed circuit
boards and other components
 • Housing, which relies on chemicals for construction
materials, sealants, coatings, paints and plastics
 • Consumer goods, such as perfumes, detergents, paper items
and pharmaceuticals Sub-segments within the Speciality Chemicals sector based
on end-usage



Key growth drivers for speciality chemicals industry in
India
Increase in consumption intensity
Higher end-user demand
Government initiatives
Favourable Global factors





Capital expenditure in the
Indian chemical space
Indian chemical industry has been
revving up its Capex over the past decade to be well equipped and more
competitive to grab future opportunities. Aggregate Capex incurred by 31
leading chemical companies considered by us has grown at a 17% CAGR over
FY15-20 and a 9% CAGR over FY10-20. INR 95bn was spent in FY20 by these
companies on Capex as compared to INR 39bn in FY10. Capex as a percentage of
revenue was 9.6% in FY20, the highest ever in the past decade. 

Companies are continuing to spend
heavily on Capex to meet the demand of these industries as they pose great growth
opportunities, given the current pandemic situation. Some companies have
delayed their Capex investments due to the COVID-19 crisis but have not
abandoned them.


Consolidation of vendor ecosystems
is an emerging theme across global chemicals supply chains, with many products
being sourced from countries with robust ecosystems. These trends stem from
cutting the need to cut costs, drive volumes and adhere to global
environmental regulations. India is well-positioned with a scalable, compliant
ecosystem for manufacturing chemicals. With the US-China political equations
impacting trade over the last few years, tariffs on Chinese exports to the
United States are rising significantly. Thus, manufacturing imports from China
to the US are declining and buyers are actively looking for new supply sources
across the world.


India is positioned to benefit from the
situation, as an emerging global manufacturing location possessing strong
product/process capabilities across a growing number of chemistries. Its robust
manufacturing ecosystem is supported by diverse raw materials availability, safety/health/environment compliance is strictly followed, and client
relationships have been deepened over the years, supported by a deep culture of
R&D as well as strong IP governance.

"Ethanol - Demand, Production, Opportunities & Production Projections (Part-2)",https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/12/ethanol-demand-production-opportunities.html,2021-12-26T06:35:00.002Z,2021-12-26T06:35:00.002Z,Unknown,"Rapid Increase in Ethanol Production Capacity
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


Two Different types of processes  to produce Ethanol







To produce 684 crore liters of ethanol by the sugar industry
by 2025-26, sugarcane equivalent to 60 LMT of surplus sugar would be diverted
to ethanol. In the current sugar season, 2020-21 more than 20 LMT of sugar is
estimated to be diverted. To produce 666 crore liters of ethanol/ alcohol from
food grains by 2025-26, about 165 LMT of food grains would be utilized. At
present damaged food grain availability is around 40 lakh tons in the country. 

In 2020-21 approximately 20 lakh ton maize is surplus FCI
Rice is also sufficient in stock (266 LMT) and it will continue to remain
robust as procurement of paddy/rice at MSP continues at expected levels. The
country is producing sufficient food grains and sugar to meet the requirement
for ethanol.

Molasses-based distilleries have also been offered interest
subvention to convert them to dual feed, to convert both food grains &
molasses into ethanol. Thus, it is expected that there would be sufficient
ethanol distillation capacity to achieve blending targets. DFPD is effectively
monitoring the situation and encouraging states and investors to set up new
industries and make sufficient availability of ethanol for blending. 

Under the PM-JIVAN scheme, 12 commercial plants and
10 demonstration plants of Second Generation (2G) Bio-Refineries (using
lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock) are planned to be set up in areas having
sufficient availability of biomass so that
ethanol is available for blending throughout the country. Already Rs. 1969.50
Crores have been earmarked for this scheme. These plants can use feedstocks
such as rice straw, wheat straw, corn cobs, corn stover, bagasse, bamboo and
woody biomass, etc.






In the year 2017-18, the installed capacity of molasses-based distilleries was around 278 crore liters. To enhance ethanol production capacity in the country, the government in July 2018 & March 2019 notified two interest subvention schemes for molasses-based distilleries. Under the aforesaid scheme of DFPD, interest subvention at the rate of 6% per annum or 50% of the rate of interest charged, whichever is lower on the loan sanctioned was borne by the central government for 5 years.


DFPD approved 368 projects for setting up of new distilleries/expansion of existing distilleries. Loans amounting to about Rs.3600 crore have been sanctioned by banks to 70 sugar mills so far; 31 projects have been completed creating a capacity of 102 crore liters as a result. The capacity of molasses-based distilleries has reached 426 crore liters. 39 more projects with a capacity of 93 crore liters are likely to be completed by March 2022 which will bring cumulative capacities to about 519 crore liters.


Intending to achieve blending targets, DFPD is making concerted efforts to enhance the ethanol distillation capacity in the country. For this, the government had invited applications from the entrepreneurs under the ethanol interest subvention schemes in September 2020 during a window of 30 days. Thus far, 238 projects for a capacity enhancement of 583 Cr liters with a loan amount of about Rs.16,000/- crore have been approved by DFPD. It is expected that at least 400 Cr liters capacity would be added to these projects by 2024.


An Integrated Bio-Refinery Model
The concept of an integrated Bio-Refinery model or Bio-park
is being envisioned which will encompass the integration of the following
facilities: 
1. 2G Ethanol plant: Second Generation or 2G ethanol plant
can convert agricultural residues like rice straw, wheat straw, energy crops, etc. to ethanol. With around 160MMT of surplus agricultural residues generated
in India annually, 2G ethanol plants offer significant opportunities in India. A
100 km per day plant can utilize 2 lakh tonne per annum of agricultural residue
to generate around 3 crore liters of ethanol per annum. 


2. Grain-based 1G Ethanol Plant - Grain-based First
Generation or 1G Ethanol Plant can convert the starch present in grains like
rice, corn, etc. to ethanol. Some by-products like CO2 & Dried Distillers
Grains with Solubles (DDGS) are also generated which can generate additional
revenue. A 100 km per day 1G plant is estimated to incur capital expenditure of
around `170 to 200 crores with a land requirement of approximately 20 acres. 


3. CBG Plant - Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) or Bio-CNG can be
produced from agricultural residue, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), cow dung, etc.
CBG can easily replace CNG. The bio-manure produced in the plant is an
additional source of revenue. The estimated capital expenditure for a 15 tonne
per day CBG plant is around Rs.60-100 crores, depending on the feedstock and
the land requirement of approx. 15 acres.


4. Production of Chemicals - Production of bio-chemicals in
the Bio-refinery will improve its economics significantly. Some technologies
for the production of biochemicals are ready for commercialization while many are
still in the development stage.


5. Cogeneration Plant - Setting up of a Cogen plant by using
Lignin (generated in 2G plant) & Biogas (CBG plant) can ensure continuous
& reliable power supply to the Bio-Refinery. Some of the advantages of Integration
of various plants in a Bio-Refinery are - 


Improved economics with reduced cost of feedstock and
sustenance of biomass supply-chain on a long-term basis. With the setting up of
1G, 2G, and CBG plants in the same premises, there can be a common source/agreement
for the supply of grains (for 1G Ethanol Plant) and supply of waste
straw/agricultural residue generated (feedstock for 2G/CBG Plants). 


Optimization of common resources like Utilities (Cooling tower, Boiler, ETP, etc.) & Offsite facilities (tankages, loading Gantry, firefighting system, etc.) can reduce capital expenditure. 


Integration of 1G ethanol and CBG plants with established
& proven technologies can bring in economic viability & sustainability
of the Bio-Refinery since 2G ethanol technologies are still in the maturing
stage. Optimization of Equipment Spares & Manpower required for
Operation / Maintenance of the plants.



The Future Landscape of Opportunities
Ethanol Industry is expected to grow by 500% By 2025, at a 20% blending level, ethanol demand will increase to 1016 Crore liters. Therefore, the worth of the ethanol industry will jump by over 500% from around 9,000 Crore to over 50,000 Crore.


Ethanol distillation capacity to grow by more than three times to 1,500 Crore liter annually Financial assistance scheme introduced by DFPD during 2018-2021 to increase ethanol production capacity.
895 proposals with a loan amount of 70,419 Crore. Estimated 165 LMT of surplus grain to be utilized annually from 2025 to produce ethanol which would result in 30,000 crore payments to farmers.


Launch of new vehicles compatible to run on E20 fuel from 2023 and flex-fuel vehicles from 2024. This will attract new investment and create employment opportunities.


Year-wise & Sector-wise Ethanol Production Projections 

The shortfall incapacity in any year can be compensated as sugar mills are also using
sugar-rich feedstocks like B heavy molasses/sugar syrup which produces 20% more ethanol of
rated capacity. Now many mills have started using these feedstocks in place of C heavy molasses.

Recent updates about the company

The chemical industry can play part in these sustainability
solutions – reducing carbon emissions, turning waste into useful products, i.e.
circular economy. Tata Chemicals can also play into chemicals going into health
and hygiene – it already plays some bit through detergents and other
applications of sodium bicarbonate.

Grow volumes & maximize realizations in soda ash (price
increased in Q2 FY22).
Timely execution of capacity expansion: Salt 165k MT by
end of FY22.

Soda ash demand drivers
Demand is likely to remain strong thanks to growing new
applications in sustainability solutions. Soda ash demand is likely to pick up
from the use of glass panels (flat glass) into solar cells, lithium carbonate
(every ton needs one ton of soda ash), and the move to container glasses from
plastics. This is likely to drive a significant uptick in soda ash demand.

Indian soda ash suppliers are in a
sweet spot. Indian soda ash suppliers are going to benefit given
(1) surplus availability of salt,
(2) good availability of limestone
and
(3) improving energy
competitiveness given the shift to compliant fuels across the globe. 


A rise in
logistics costs has reduced the competitiveness of imports from markets like
the US and Kenya into India and Southeast Asian markets. Synthetic soda ash
from India is likely to turn competitive for exports too in Southeast Asia as
well as the Middle East apart from becoming more competitive within India.


Growth in near terms
·       
First tranche of Soda Ash, Bicarb & Salt
expansion on stream by FY23, delivering incremental revenues.
·       
Continue to focus on costs.
·       
Qualification with customers on Prebiotics &
Silica
 
International business
Export price maximization &
target higher domestic realizations during contract renewals in Q4 FY 22.
Hold volumes & pricing - Target
higher realizations during contract renewals in Q4 FY 22.
Operational efficiencies through
cost structure rationalization.
Sustain volume growth momentum.
 
China is unlikely to increase its capacities.
Chinese soda ash capacities may
not increase substantially on the synthetic side given
(1) limited availability of salt
and
(2) declining use of ammonium
chloride (a byproduct in Hou process which Chinese use for synthetic soda ash)
as a fertilizer.


Natural soda ash demand
Natural soda ash capacities in
China are growing in Mongolia but are uncompetitive vis-a-vis China due to
higher logistics costs. As per internal estimations of Tata Chemicals, China is
likely to continue to be a net importer.


The natural soda ash market has three
sources of supply. Turkey, Kenya, and the US are the three sources of supply for
natural soda ash. Turkey is likely to have reached optimal capacity levels and
is unlikely to see an incremental supply increase. Geopolitical instability is
also likely to play a part in keeping supply/demand in check. Kenya and the US
are also likely to remain stable and contribute only to local growth markets.
The US may support incremental growth in LATAM due to increased use in lithium
carbonate.

Overall pricing environment to tighten driving better RoCEs
on new projects. Turkey-led supply disruption is already behind us. With most
of the markets not adding substantial capacities, demand-supply would get
tightened with most soda ash buyers likely to focus on gaining supply security.

External factors
No headwinds in the medium term in terms of environmental
activism environmental laws are already high in the US. TCL operations are
fully compliant and protective of the environment. In Kenya, the company is not
facing any legal challenges so far and working out on royalty rates with the government.
Lake Magadi in Kenya is a self-replenishing lake company so doesn’t see
challenges on the sustainability side.

Capacity expansion
Tata Chemicals has headroom to expand capacity in the US by
10%-12% over current capacity. India offers the best returns on incremental
investments followed by Kenya for new capacity expansion.

Tata Chemicals is looking for Rs26 bn investments in India
soda ash and allied products expansion as well as Rs9 bn investments in Rallis.
They have a few more projects in the pipeline which will get announced
gradually.

Tata Chemicals sees multiple solutions for storage
and mobility. It is an evolving field and many plays are possible in hydrogen
cells as well as batteries. In both, electrochemistry is used and hence Tata
Chemicals is confident about doing well in either space. Tata Chemical's intent
is to play directly as well apart from their presence through soda ash. They
are also entering the area of battery recycling.

Introduction
The global construction industry makes up
about 12% of the world's GDP and construction is one of the main drivers of
growth in almost every economy. The Global Construction & Building
Materials Market size was estimated at USD 916.31 billion in 2019 and is
expected to reach USD 946.26 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 5.76% reaching USD
1,282.56 billion by 2025. 


A variety of chemicals and advanced materials (CAMs)—
ranging from concrete admixtures to polymer composites— are increasingly being
used in the buildings and construction industry. Construction CAMs include
concrete admixtures, adhesives and sealants, protective coatings, insulation
materials, and polymer composites.


As with other areas of the specialty
chemicals sector, the construction chemicals industry is directly affected by
increased globalization, consolidation, and significant consumption growth in
rapidly developing markets. So, it is not surprising that the future growth
rate for construction CAMs are expected to be more than 6-8% per annum, with the
most incremental growth emanating from the Asia-Pacific region. An uptick in
construction and building activity driven by rapid urbanization and a growing
population is expected to be a major impetus behind this impressive growth.



Opportunities
The construction chemicals industry will
see continued opportunities to address energy conservation and sustainability.
Suppliers can benefit from government policies that require the use of
specialty construction chemical products to aid in energy conservation.


The Indian construction chemicals market is
estimated to witness healthy growth, at an estimated CAGR of over 8%, over
the forecast period. The Indian construction chemicals market follows a
slightly different trend than that of the global market. Due to the lack of awareness
about the long-term benefits of construction chemicals, the demand for
chemicals, such as concrete admixtures, adhesives, sealants, and waterproofing,
which have immediate tangible effects, is high.



A booming market for construction chemicals
and advanced materials
The global construction CAMs market is expected
to grow from $57 billion in 2016 to $87 billion by 2023, clocking a CAGR of
more than 6 percent. The highest contribution to the incremental growth from
2016 to 2023 will likely come from the Asia-Pacific region, specifically China,
India, and Southeast Asia.


Global market size and growth of

2. Sustainability and the circular economy
3. Trends in project completion timelines and
overall costs
4. Skilled labor shortage


Building & construction chemicals market (USD Billion)




Investment policies
Target to increase the share of
manufacturing in GDP to at least 25% by 2025 (from current 16%). Investments in
manufacturing in the chemical sector are essential to ensure the growth of the
Indian chemical industry Government’s proposal to set up a technology
up-gradation fund of ~USD 80 Mn in the 12th plan for chemicals. 
Proposal to
establish an autonomous USD 100 Mn chemical innovation fund by securing 10% of
the total inclusive national innovation fund set up by the National Innovation
Council to encourage commercialization efforts for innovations generating
inclusive growth.



The
governments of developed as well as developing countries are focusing highly on
green building standards. The new policies are exerting more pressure on
construction ventures to use chemicals that have the lowest carbon footprint
and are less resource-intensive. The invention of the newest chemicals is
becoming preferable in the construction industry. 


The infrastructure segment
for the construction chemicals market shall experience significant growth in
the global market and it is expected to register a revenue of $12.8 billion
during the forecast period, increasing at a CAGR of 6.2%. Extensively growing
urbanization and increasing population are the major reasons for the growth of
infrastructure in the global market.

Companies -  USD 300 bn  domestic market by 2025


Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


India’s
chemical industry was estimated to be worth USD 178 billion in FY 2019-20 and
has a significant potential to reach USD 300 billion by FY 2024-25. In terms of
demand, the industry has grown at approximately 1.3 times the country’s average
GDP growth in the last five years and shows a strong linkage with its GDP. Indian
specialty chemical sector has grown at 12%+ in the last five years and is well
poised to expand its global market share to 7-8% from 4% in the coming years. 


The
structural drivers are in place like global best practice manufacturing
standard and R&D capability along with government impetus of make in India
policy with pro-growth policies will act as a further catalyst for growth.
Further, a global MNC looking at China Plus one strategy will help Indian
incumbents to gain market share. In the short to medium term, supply
disruptions emerging from power outages in China along with limited new
capacity addition provides a tactical opportunity for Indian players to increase
market share and also will get benefits for increase in products prices.


Demand
for chemicals in India is poised to reach USD 300bn by FY25 from USD 178bn in
FY20, according to the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals’ presentation
during its India Chem March 2021 Conference. Demographic dividend, low per
capita consumption, growing disposable income, urbanization, rural consumer
penetration, increasing export demand and government initiatives are key growth
drivers. The industry has already started to focus on CAPEX to build new capacity,
driven by a revenue CAGR of 10% and 21% EBITDA margin over FY18-21.


Opportunities led by government
push, production linked schemes
The government had announced
a PLI scheme in FY20 to incentivize incremental sales from domestic units
manufacturing automobiles, pharma, food products & textiles, which would
drive domestic demand for specialty chemicals for polymers, resins, fibers,
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), bulk chemicals, paints, pigments, and
food additives. It overhauled the Petroleum, Chemicals, and Petrochemicals
Investment Region (PCPIR) policy to encourage investment of INR 20tn by FY35.
 
Changing
China dynamics 
In sharp contrast to China,
most chemical manufacturers in India are largely in compliance with emissions
norms due to stricter environmental policies, and as a result, are already done
with significant investment in environment-friendly processes. However, during
the past decade, the same spending on environmental compliance has led to
domestic products becoming costlier than China’s.
 
With the stricter
environment norms in China and consequent supply uncertainty, India’s chemicals
companies are at an inflection point of gaining major share globally, resulting
in increased capacity utilization and margins.
 
Consolidation in the industry,
environmental reforms, and tightened financing is changing the structure of
China’s chemical industry, resulting in uncertainty for companies dependent on
the country for their supply of raw material. In addition, the COVID-19
outbreak has compelled companies to move their supplier base and look for
alternative locations such as India that offer the advantage on low-cost labor
and favorable investment policies.


Impact
of China’s policy on Indian Chemical Companies


China’s chemicals industry
is facing structural headwinds in the form of tightening environment norms,
stricter financing, and consolidation, leading to global supply concerns. These
factors promote India as a strong global supplier. As per BCG Survey, 44% of US
CFOs and 25% of North Asian CFOs say firms are already moving production out of
China.
 
Indian Specialty chemical industry witnessed
strong y-o-y demand and improved pricing scenario (led by cost-push) in general
during Q2. Such a scenario couple with a covid impacted base of last year makes
the revenue trend strong.
 
While there is some sequential
stagnation in the demand trends driven by the trade challenges, the product
prices remained firm/stable in Q2 primarily driven by a spike in input/freight
cost. While Crude prices saw a steady rise (+67% YoY, +4% QoQ), the prices of
most key inputs like - Benzene (127% YoY, -3% QoQ), Toluene (74% YoY, 5% QoQ),
Phenol (118% YoY, 13% QoQ), caprolactum (115% YoY, 28% QoQ), etc have doubled.




India’s specialty chemicals
companies are expanding their capacities to cater to rising demand from
domestic and overseas. With global companies seeking to de-risk their supply
chains, which are dependent on China, the chemical sector in India has the
opportunity for significant growth.
 
Most Indian specialty chemical peers have
either integrated their product portfolio or added downstream products in the
recent past, keeping their margins firm. On the other hand, the sharp rise in
container cost and its unavailability brings in trade challenges and margin
pressure. However stronger sales drive overall earnings momentum.
 
Increasing investments and spending to boost the growth
A
Petroleum, Chemicals, and Petrochemicals Investment Region are expected to attract investments worth
7.63 lakh crores (US$ 104.36 Billion). Indian chemical companies spend ~1% of
their revenue on R&D. An investment of 8 lakh crores (US$ 107.38 Billion)
is estimated in the Indian chemical and Petrochemicals sector by 2025.


The rise in demand from end-user industries such as food processing, personal care, and home care is driving the development of different segments in India’s specialty chemicals market. The domestic chemicals sector’s small and medium enterprises are expected to showcase 18-23% revenue growth in FY 2021-22, owing to an improvement in domestic demand and higher realization due to high prices of chemicals. Around USD 17.1bn of petrochemical
projects of 9.2mn tonne products capacity are under implementation in India,
which would help drive competitiveness of downstream chemicals industry due
to availability of cheaper feedstock to cater to rising domestic demand.

Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


Specialty Chemical Article: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/07/speciality-chemicals-market-size-demand.html
Government scheme to boost: https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/07/government-initiatives-to-boost-growth.html


Indian specialty chemicals companies are
poised to ride tailwinds from macro drivers including ‘China+1’, import-substitution, growing costs within China (capital, operational, compliances), and currency benefits. Recent disruptions in China will cause medium-term challenges for downstream producers while benefiting base chemical suppliers. More importantly, these frequent supply disruptions in China further strengthen the case for quality Indian players in the chemical domain.


Growing import substitution by local industry makes a case for strengthening
volume growth for base chemical/intermediate suppliers. Recent disruptions in China (electricity
shortages, targeted plant closures) open another round of challenges for
already stretched chemical supply chains globally and in India. China seems to
be targeting companies/industries with higher energy consumption intensity and
polluting technologies. This is likely to drive volume shortages along with
significant price spikes for key raw materials.



Indian Specialty chemical
industry witnessed strong yoy demand and improved pricing scenario (led by
cost-push) in general during Q2. Such a scenario couple with the covid impacted
base of last year makes the revenue trend strong. India has a small 4% of the
global chemicals market that is growing at 5-6% in dollar terms. This suggests
that even a 15% CAGR in INR terms over the next 15 years would garner just an
8% global market share. This is modest given the expected and strategic
lowering of chemical exports by China (representing a 13-15% chunk of the
global market).




China’s chemical
industry has shifted its focus to self-sufficiency and high value-added
products
Three
phases of Chinese chemicals industry growth





Recent developments further reiterate
China’s intent to not support capital inefficient and carbon inefficient
(whether energy or emissions) businesses. This is a departure from the policies
adopted over 2000-15. Cost structures would rise thanks to rising wages, energy
costs, appreciating currencies, and higher capital costs needed to meet
increased regulatory expectations. Indian players with proven chemistry skills,
world-class manufacturing, and the ability to build strong client engagements will
benefit.



Base chemicals to benefit in the near term  
Commodities such as soda ash, caustic
soda, acetates, and PVC are already rallying on the back of these dual controls.
In most of these commodities, pricing is a function of import parity and
manufacturers of these commodities would benefit over the next 3-6 months.
Volume benefits may be limited as any capacity expansion to take advantage of
such shortages takes time, but price hikes would aid.


Over a longer period, China’s intent to
cut down exports of these energy-intensive industries augurs well for the
pricing environment in general. The challenges, however, would be the intent of
Indian companies to invest capital and demonstrate execution capabilities to do
these high-ticket projects and their competitiveness versus countries like
Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which may still have better infrastructure to
benefit from these capital-heavy projects (not chemistry-heavy unlike a few
specialty chemicals).




Indian chemicals players are expected to
benefit from higher commodity prices where China has dominance.

List
of chemical commodities, China’s share of global capacity, and Indian players
present in these chemicals



India’s chemicals market share would reach only 8.3% in 2035 despite 15% growth CAGR India market share projections assuming 5% global market growth in US$, 3% annual benefit, and 15% domestic industry growth share.

What makes an Indian
specialty chemicals company scalable?
There are three lenses
through which investors should view this sector: 
(1) Differentiation of process capabilities, 
(2) Asset discipline (return on capital, return on carbon),
(3) Client engagement (trust, transparency). 


Indian specialty chemical sector has grown
at 12%+ in the last five years and is well poised to expand its global market
share to 7-8% from 4% in the coming years. The structural drivers are in place
like global best practice manufacturing standard and R&D capability along
with government impetus of make in India policy with pro-growth policies will
act as a further catalyst for growth.



Further, a global MNC looking at China +1 strategy will help Indian incumbents to
gain market share. In the short to medium term, supply disruptions emerging
from power outages in China along with limited new capacity addition provides a
tactical opportunity for Indian players to increase market share and will get
benefits for an increase in products prices.

In continuation with the previous Ethanol blog here is an extended version with more new Insights!


With a view to
give a boost to the agriculture sector and to reduce environmental pollution,
the government of India had launched pilot projects in 2001 wherein, 5% ethanol
blended petrol was supplied to retail outlets. Apart from field trials, R&D
studies were also simultaneously conducted. The success of these field trials
and studies paved the way for EBP in India. The Government of India vide its
Resolution dated 3rd September 2002 decided to launch Ethanol Blended Petrol
(EBP) Program in January 2003 for sale of 5% ethanol blended petrol in nine
States and four UTs.
 
The global
production of fuel ethanol touched 110 billion liters in 2019 showing an
average growth of 4% a year per year during the last decade. The United States of
America (USA) and Brazil contribute for 92 billion liters (84% of global share)
followed by European Union (EU), China, India, Canada, and Thailand. In order to
increase the availability of ethanol for transport use, many initiatives have
been taken by various countries across the world.

Currently the
annual ethanol production capacity in India is around 6.5 billion liters. The majority of the ethanol production is based on sugary feedstock mainly cane
molasses and a small but growing proportion of starchy feedstock. Oil Marketing
Companies (OMCs) have contracted about 3.3 billion liters for the 2020-21 marketing
year, including about 0.4 billion liters from the starchy feedstock. 


This would
enable India to have ethanol blending of 8.5% for the ethanol supply year Dec
2020- Nov 2021. India has recently announced the advancing of a 20% ethanol blending
target by 5 years, from 2030 to 2025. This is expected to create the opportunity for
additional 10 billion liters per annum ethanol capacity.


 
The country’s recent move to allow the direct sale of
ethanol as a fuel for compatible automobiles is further expected to support the
higher ethanol demand. This will significantly create and build opportunities
for ethanol plant capacity expansion. Currently, the majority of the ethanol
production in the country is dominated by three states namely Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra and Karnataka produce ethanol using sugary feedstock.



In
a significant move to encourage countrywide ethanol production, India expanded
the basket of feedstock with the inclusion of starchy feedstock. Several enabling
factors such as interest subvention for projects, five-year buying visibility,
upward price revisions, quick environmental clearance, etc. are introduced to
attract investments in the sector.


Impact on Consumer,
vehicle manufacturer and component manufacturer by using Biofuel


Impact on the
consumer
1. Fuel
Efficiency: While using E20 fuel, there will be a drop in fuel efficiency by
nearly 
(a) 6-7% for 4 wheelers designed for E0 and calibrated for E10, 
(b) 3-4% for 2
wheelers designed for E0 and calibrated for E10 
(c) 1-2% for 4
wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. 


However, with the
modifications in engines (hardware and tuning), the loss in efficiency due to
blended fuel can be reduced.


2. Startability:
In the E20 project, the results indicated that the test vehicles passed stability
and drivability tests at hot and cold conditions with E0 and E20 test fuel. In all the cases, there was no severe malfunction or stall observed at any stage
of vehicle operation.
 
Impact on the
vehicle manufacturer 
The following
changes in the production line will be necessary to produce compatible
vehicles. 
1. Engines and
components will need to be tested and calibrated with E20 as fuel. 
2. Vendors need
to be developed for the procurement of additional components compatible with
E20. All the components required can be made available in the country. 
3. No significant
change in the assembly line is expected. 
 
Impact on the
component manufacturer 
1. There will be
no major structural change in the components in migrating from E10 to E20. 
2. There will be
changes in the material of piston rings, piston heads, O-rings, seals, fuel pumps
etc., all of which can be produced in the country.
 
Quantity
Supplied (Ethanol) and %Blending Trends


As starchy feedstock is available across the nation, it will help build up a robust
ecosystem for the nationwide production of ethanol. The ethanol industry structure in
the country is undergoing a radical shift with changes across dimensions of
ownership, feedstock, and geographical location for the production of ethanol.



India’s
requirement of ethanol for petrol blending will increase from 173 crore liters
in 2019-20 to 1,016 crore liters in 2025-26. To meet this demand, the ethanol
production capacity will have to be increased from 684 crore liters in 2019-20
to 1,500 crore liters in 2025-26. This includes a production capacity of (i) 740
crore liters of grain-based ethanol, and (ii) 760 crore sugar-based ethanol.


Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas should notify a plan for availability of
E10 fuel (blend of 10% ethanol and 90% petrol) by
April 2022. Further, the Ministry should notify a
plan for the continued availability of fuel for older
vehicles. Fuel blended with 20% ethanol (E20)
should be launched in a phased manner from April
2023 to ensure availability of E20 by 2025. The
rollout of higher ethanol blends may be done in a phased manner, starting with the states with surplus
production of ethanol.

five years and has only been accelerated with the Coronavirus pandemic.


The global veterinary telehealth market size was valued at USD 92.0 million in 2020 and is expected to expand at
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% from 2021 to 2028. The growing
adoption of these management systems can be attributed to the steady growth in
the focus on veterinary telehealth along with disease detection.

Furthermore, there is high demand
and an increasing rate of consumption for animal-derived products is
anticipated to drive the market. This growing demand is eventually increasing
the need to protect animals from diseases. Telehealth is the overarching term
that encompasses all uses of technology geared to remotely deliver health
information or education. Telemedicine is the use of medical information
exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications regarding a
patient's clinical health status.



Significant revenue opportunity in multiproduct cross-selling

Given the current state of
technological capabilities, available research, and the current state and federal
regulatory landscape, the veterinary telemedicine should only be conducted
within an existing Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR), with the
exception for advice given in an emergency until that patient can be seen by a
veterinarian.


Telehealth can be divided into
categories based on who is involved in the communication. For communication
between veterinarians and animal owners, there are two important categories that
are distinguished by whether a VCPR has been established.

Without a VCPR, telehealth includes the delivery
of general advice, educational information, and teletriage (to support the care
of animals in emergency situations). Telemedicine includes the delivery of
information specific to a particular patient and is allowable only within the
context of an established VCPR.

The VCPR ensures that a veterinarian
is readily available for follow-up evaluation, or has arranged for veterinary
emergency coverage and continuing care and treatment. The veterinarian is
expected to provide oversight of treatment, compliance, and outcome, as well as
document the patient’s continuing care and treatment in the medical record. The
animal owner’s consent for the use of telemedicine must also be obtained and
documented.



The veterinary diagnostics segment is expected
to witness a lucrative CAGR of 11.7% from 2021 to 2028. Various factors, such
as the increasing number of veterinary practitioners & their incomes in
developed economies, growing animal health expenditure, and rising incidence of
zoonotic diseases, are responsible for segment growth. Companies are investing
in the expansion of their manufacturing facilities, which is expected to
positively influence the market growth over the forecast period.

The teleconsulting segment held
the majority of the revenue share of 29.1% in 2020. The segment growth is
attributed to the rising usage among veterinarians to seek consultation from
the veterinary specialist via telehealth tools to gain advice and insights
regarding the care of the animal. Further, teleconsultation saves
transportation costs and reduces ancillary expenses. Thus, expert advice can be
taken on an immediate basis without wasting the time for long waiting hours.
Such factors are propelling the segment market growth.



The key advantages of veterinary
telehealth such as saving transportation costs and reduction of ancillary
expenses are driving the growth of the market. In addition, the doctor's advice
and virtual care can be obtained on an immediate basis. Further, it also saves
time as animal caretakers can skip the time consumed during long waiting hours.
Such factors are boosting the market growth.


Source: Life MD+

There is increased adoption of animals
by farmers and pet parents. This can be attributed to the increase in internet
penetration and user-friendly animal healthcare websites or apps. Such factors
are anticipated to increase the demand for veterinary telehealth over the
forecast period. In addition, increasing cases of zoonotic diseases coupled
with the concern of owners about their animal health is also propelling the
growth of the market.

According to the survey results,
64% of consumers showed an increased willingness to adopt teleconsultation
post—Covid-19. On the other hand, doctors are also trying to reduce the
non-essential visits of the patients with approximately 80% of them being
consulted using informal means of consultation such as audio, video, and texts
messages through various apps.

Source: American Animal Health Association

Telemedicine is creating pathways for pet
parents to engage with veterinarians, get advice, and obtain some level of
treatment with less friction. “The train has left the station in the adoption of
telemedicine or telehealth going forward. Pet parents have already seen that
for some cases, for triage or small questions, they can work with telemedicine
from their armchair at the hours that they like.”


Thus, there is an immediate need for a strong regulatory framework in the interest of patients /consumers. As per the study,
India’s e-pharmacy market is projected to reach 10%-12% of overall
pharmaceutical sales in the next five years driven by strong regulations,
increased funding and the creation of digital infrastructure. The pandemic has
highlighted the need to build a simplified and holistic teleconsultation
platform, guided by the robust regulatory and policy framework, encompassing
all key stakeholders.

The
applications of biotechnology are so extensive that, currently, almost all
industries can use this technology. This means that these industries can
produce new or better products faster and more efficiently. Biotech beauty
technically refers to ingredients that are generated with DNA editing and the
help of organisms like algae, yeast, or bacteria. Biosynthesis is a multi-step,
enzyme-catalyzed process where substrates are converted into more complex
products in living organisms. In the biosynthesis stage, simple compounds are
modified, converted, or joined together to form macromolecules.


Compounds like hyaluronic acid, squalane, and even collagen can be produced at high levels and in a completely pure and
environmentally responsible way. In many ways, biotech can improve on what Mother Nature
has provided through evolution. Then the building blocks of organic compounds
are isolated, chemical energy is simulated, and cells are fermented, which
causes them to multiply and grow. While these fermented cells, i.e., the
biosynthetic ingredients, are bioidentical to ingredients that live in nature,
Jay says their sustainability benefits are significant.



A New Opportunity for the Industry
The global natural cosmetics market size was estimated at USD 34.12 billion in 2018 and is projected to
register a CAGR of 5.01% from 2019 to 2025 reaching at a valuation of USD 48.04
billion by 2025. Increasing demand for beauty
products coupled with the rising awareness about environment-friendly products
is expected to drive the growth. 


With more consumers demanding
potent but safe products and environmentally responsible beauty and wellness
solutions, K-beauty, and other major markets are already looking to biotech
companies for new formulations of everything from hyaluronic acid to collagen. The sweet spot where biotech beauty is most valuable is that it combines sustainability, efficacy, and safety in one fell swoop.


Driving forces of the cosmetics industry
The cosmetics industry will
undergo a paradigm shift in overall product creation from basic research to
development to marketing.

In basic research, biotechnology will become
increasingly more important due to advanced research in protecting skin from
aging. In the development stage, electronics, information technology, food, and medical technologies will intersect, leading to the development of converged
products and solutions. In marketing, as consumers’ knowledge increases,
advertising highlighting research and development and stressing high-tech
materials will be an appealing point rather than an emphasis on image.




Biotechnology
has had an impact on cosmetics in several ways. Cosmetics companies use
biotechnology to discover, develop, and produce components of cosmetic
formulations and to evaluate the activity of these components on the skin, in
particular, how they can affect the changes associated with aging. 


Thus,
biotechnology represents a good alternative tool for developing active
ingredients that are able to slow down the aging process. In this review, we
focus on the description of all the active ingredients obtained through
biotechnological processes, found in the available literature.
 
Fermentation
Processes – Role in Beauty Biotechnology
Classical
biotechnology is related to fermentation processes, which are defined as
operations where microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, and some
enzymes are used to obtain biotechnological products. Microorganisms have
proved to be particularly useful owing to their ease of mass cultivation, speed
of growth, use of cheap substrates, and the diversity of products they can
originate.



In
most industrial fermentation processes, there are several stages. These can
include several stages of propagation of the inoculum (starter culture), pilot-scale fermentation, and the main production fermentation.
 
Biotechnology
is defined as the application of knowledge in life sciences to create products
or services that are beneficial to humans, being used to improve the quality
and efficiency of food production, or even the production of cosmetic active
ingredients, drugs, and vaccines. The selective breeding of animals the
cultivation of crops and the use of microorganisms to produce products such as
cheese, yogurt, bread, beer, and wine are considered previous forms of
biotechnology. Currently, biotechnology places more emphasis on the development
of hybrid genes, followed by their transfer to different organisms.



Cosmetics
companies use biotechnology to discover, develop, and produce components of
cosmetic formulations and to evaluate the activity of these components on the
skin, in particular, how they can affect the changes associated with aging.
Thus, biotechnology represents a good alternative tool for developing active
ingredients that are able to slow down the aging process.
 
Over the past two centuries, science has made revolutionary breakthroughs
across every plane of human life. Causally, our standards of beauty, as well as
our capacities in this pursuit, have changed. As we continue marching forth in
our development of cutting-edge technology, the boundaries between different
industries—such as Biotechnology, cosmetics, and healthcare—erode. The
scientific innovations of today will be the products we use tomorrow, and we
are now in a position to begin to analyze the real-world effects of these
technologies in regard to the cosmetics industry, whilst still keeping in mind
the broader implications for society as a whole.



While sometimes successful – artificially selecting wolves into
domesticated dogs – such efforts were painstakingly long and inefficient.
Humanity is now in a fundamentally different position in regard to our ability
to manipulate and engineer the collective biology of the earth, and much of
this progress is being made in the field of Biotechnology.



In the cosmetics industry, various types of enzymes are used to
develop formulations that facilitate the course of biochemical skin reactions,
protecting the skin from aging. These enzymes are also responsible for
protecting the skin against some external agents such as UV radiation and
against free radicals.



Human growth factors are considered extraordinary
molecules in the cosmetics industry, thanks to their important role in skincare. The use of these molecules for skin rejuvenation is thought to be an
emerging and promising strategy. Advances in knowledge of the role of growth
factors in wound healing and regeneration have aroused great interest in the
role that these molecules may play in the repair of skin structures.
 
Role
of Algae & Micro-organisms for cosmetic products
Billions of years ago, algae adapted to adverse and
competitive environments, producing compounds and secondary metabolites for
their protection, and being able to live in a wide range of ecological niches.
Algae size ranges from microscopic individual microalgae cells to much larger organisms,
macroalgae, which may reach above 30 m.



Currently, the cosmetics market has gained interest
worldwide, owing to more active and consistent participation of consumers,
who started to use these products more frequently.
The cosmetics industry, through biotechnological
processes have contributed to obtaining a wide variety of cosmetic active ingredients.

Thus,
biotechnology, cosmetics, and aesthetic medicines have been closely intertwined,
allowing for new effective and safe formulations of active ingredients. This is
a very promising area, currently, the number of biotechnological cosmetic
products is rising, and its increase is expected soon.

In the last few decades, India has made significant advancements in the way
healthcare has been delivered in the country. In the context of the COVID-19 public
health emergency, the use of digital health technologies, including software as
a medical device or other digital therapeutics solutions may improve mental
health and well-being of patients with psychiatric conditions during periods of
shelter-in-place, isolation, and quarantine. In addition, by reducing patient
contact with, and proximity to, healthcare providers, can ease the burden on
hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals who are
experiencing increased demand due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.



1. Telehealth in India
The pandemic has highlighted the need to build a
simplified and holistic teleconsultation platform encompassing all key
stakeholders. With the current levels of adoption by the patient–consumers and
doctors, along with emerging teleconsultation platforms, India has commenced
its teleconsultation journey. The ‘Now’ has witnessed a massive expansion of
tele–consulting as doctors and patients are restricted to interact in person.
Telehealth and its Division





2. Consumption of telehealth services in India
In
response to the growing need for teleconsultation, pharmaceutical companies are
also proactively engaging with teleconsultation platform providers to establish
a connection between the doctors and the patients.


Source: IPA


Teleconsultation and e–pharmacy
platforms have shown steep growth in adoption by both,
doctors as well as patients. For e.g., Fortis Healthcare has
witnessed the shift in the outpatient department (OPD)
consultation with 10% of the pre–COVID-19 consultations
moving to the teleconsultation platform. 


3. Scope for Telemedicine in India


What is Telemedicine?
It is the practice of medicine using technology
to deliver healthcare services remotely. A registered physician at one location
uses telecommunications infrastructure to deliver care to a patient at a
distant location.



Source: IPA

Telemedicine can play a particularly important role in cases
where there is no need for the patient to physically see the RMP (or other
medical professional), e.g. for regular, routine check-ups or continuous
monitoring. Telemedicine can reduce the burden on secondary hospitals.

The telemedicine market in India is expected to
grow at a CAGR of 31% for the period 2020–25 and
reach US$5.5b. Virtual care constitutes teleconsultation, telepathology,
teleradiology, and e–pharmacy and is experiencing an encouraging stimulus in
India was due to the pandemic. This stimulus has the potential to make
teleconsultation and e-pharmacy account for ~95% of the telemedicine market by 2025
which amounts to US$5.2 billion.


5. Telemedicine Market Regionwise 



Source: GM Market research

The market value for the global telemedicine market has been
continuously growing from $18.1 billion in 2015 to $30.5 billion as of 2019.
The market is forecast to expand to $35.5 billion this year and to $41.2
billion next year.

6. Telemedicine in
Animal Healthcare
U.S Veterinary telehealth market size, by service type 2016-2028 (USD Million)



Source: Grandview Research
Telemedicine, telehealth, and virtual care are recent
buzzwords in veterinary medicine, despite veterinarians practicing it for
years. Before the Coronavirus, the veterinary industry was slow to adopt
telehealth solutions. 


There were numerous driving factors but the three main
ones that were heard over and over again was that pet owners did not have
issues getting access to veterinarians, clinics did not equip to integrate
technology into their offerings and veterinarians were concerned with
liability surrounding remote consultations.

There has been a surge in adoptions around the
world for “Pandemic Puppies” and “Corona Kittens”. It is uncertain what the
effects will be as pet owners return to work and children to school. There will
have to be a fundamental shift in business models for veterinarians.



The increasing prevalence of diseases such as diabetes,
kidney diseases, spinal disc problems, and blood pressure related issues are
further fueling the market for veterinary telehealth. 

7. Key
Factors driving Telemedicine






8. Factors Triggering the Growth of Telehealth Solutions



There is an increasing number of populations worldwide suffering from chronic disease. Moreover, the geriatric population and home healthcare have become a necessity in an urban environment.
On-demand healthcare apps and high
     mobile penetration amongst every age group is another reason contributing
     to the growth of telehealth solutions.
Technological advancements,
     telehealth coverage in insurance is another factor fueling the growth of
     telehealth solutions at the global level.



9. Telemedicine – Enabler of Healthcare Access and Affordability
There are a number of benefits of telemedicine. It increases
timely access to appropriate interventions including faster access and access
to services that may not otherwise be available. In India, providing In-person
healthcare is challenging, particularly given the large geographical distances
and limited resources.

One of the major advantages of telemedicine can
be for the saving of cost and effort especially for rural patients, as they need not
travel long distances for obtaining consultation and treatment. In this type of
scenario, telemedicine can provide an optimal solution for not just providing
timely and faster access. It would also reduce financial costs associated with
travel. It also reduces the inconvenience/impact to family and caregivers and
social factors.


Triggered
by Covid-19 pandemic, Healthtech is poised for rapid growth and will keep
attracting public and private investments. There shall be the further acceleration
in fundraising by startups, M&A deals, and IPOs with the evolution of a
robust health tech ecosystem in India.

The US, Germany, China, Brazil, Iran, etc., are a few key countries that import Indian medical devices. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu are the manufacturing hubs for medical devices in India.


Medical devices consist of instruments, apparatus, machines,
implants, in-vitro reagents among others that are intended for use in the
diagnosis of other conditions. These devices are also used in the process of
cure, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals. Large- and
small-scale medical device companies play a role in the development of new
medical devices. Thus, owing to these developments medical device industry is
projected to witness significant growth in the upcoming years.


The rising number of medical facilities will boost the demand for
medical devices in the market. Various government initiatives such as ‘Production Linked
Incentives (PLI) Scheme for Medica Devices 2020’ and establishing medical parks
will augment demand.
The Indian medical device is driven by 75- 80% imports from
countries such as the US, China, and Germany.


The
government is planning to develop/create a manufacturing base for medical
devices in India and encourage exports, as it recognizes this sector as a
sunrise sector.




Major
Investments in Medical Sector
The medical Device sector has attracted significant investments over the
years. The government plans to invest significantly in establishing medical devices
parks in four states of India - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and
Kerala. 


100% FDI will boost investments from private companies in
this sector to further incentivize investments in the manufacturing of medical
devices, in May 2020, the Central Government of India announced incentivization
plans of at least Rs. 3,420 crore (US$ 4.9 billion) over a period of five
years and these funds will be offered to manufacturers only if they invest in
set-ups to produce key medical devices. 


In May 2020, AiMeD (an Umbrella Association of Indian
Manufacturers of Medical Devices) invited Japanese investors who were
interested in setting up a manufacturing base for medical devices (including
medical electronics & IVD) in India. As a part of the initiative, India is
targeting 1200 technical collaborations with Indian investors for JPY 600
billion (US$ 5746.7 million) and above, 200 joint ventures with foreign
investors for JPY 200 billion (US$ 1903.8 million) and above, and 50 MNCs for
JPY 200 billion (US$ $ 1903.8 million) and above.


In September 2020, Thiruvananthapuram-based Sree Chitra
Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology announced that it will
collaborate with the Kerala government to set up an Rs. 260 crore (US$ 35.44
million) medical devices park in Thonnakkal (Thiruvanthapuram).

Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar
The global chemicals market is valued
at around USD 4,738 billion and is expected to grow at 6.2% CAGR reaching USD
6,400 billion by 2024. The Indian chemicals market is valued at USD 166 billion
(~4% share in the global chemical industry) and it is expected to reach ~USD
280-300 Bn in the next 5 years, with an anticipated growth of ~12% CAGR. The
specialty chemical industry forms ~47% of the domestic chemical market, which
is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 11-12% over the same period.


Stronger
growth lead by Government Initiatives
India’s
growth story was largely positive based on the strength of domestic absorption
and the economy was registering a steady pace of economic growth pre-Covid.
Moreover, its other macroeconomic parameters like inflation, fiscal deficit and
current account balance had exhibited distinct signs of improvement. Though the
pandemic has led to a short-term slowdown of the economy, the medium-long term
fundamentals are sound & India is expected to witness the revival of its
economy soon.



Aatmanirbhar
Bharat Abhiyan
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May
12, 2020 announced the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan which combined relief,
policy reforms and fiscal and monetary measures to help businesses and
individuals to cope with the situation created by the pandemic and helps
transform India into a self-reliant economy. The government seized the crisis to
push forward long-pending industrial & other economic reforms in the least politically resistant atmosphere.

• This campaign is especially expected
to benefit the Specialty chemicals sector, with several players hoping to
position themselves as an alternative to China as the coronavirus crisis
prompts companies to diversify their supply chains.

• Govt. announced a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the promotion and manufacturing of pharmaceutical
raw materials in India. The government’s move is aimed to boost domestic manufacturing and cut dependence on imports of critical Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredients (APIs).
Further, the government has also decided to develop three
mega bulk drug parks in partnership with states. These schemes will likely appeal
more to the smaller players and should foster more investments. The government
is soon planning to roll out such a scheme for the chemicals sector as well.

• The government is also in the
process of launching a production-linked incentive (PLI) for the chemical
sector to increase self-reliance in the country. This move is to reduce the country’s
dependency on imports of basic chemicals. The PLI scheme will help the sector
to identify import-dependent chemicals and work towards producing them within
the country.



• Specialty
chemical companies will look at import substitution along with export
opportunities to further drive their business. Historically, domestic
consumption has been the driving metric for Specialty chemicals manufacturing
in India, with exports playing a much smaller part – owing to reduced raw
material availability, higher utility tariffs, and a stricter regulatory
structure. However, owing to the current geopolitical issues, India’s focus on
being a manufacturing hub for exports of specialty chemicals will increase,
subsequently increasing the share of exports in the overall market.

Commodity Chemicals
The commodity chemicals market includes companies that manufacture basic chemicals in large volumes. These include plastics, synthetic fibers, films, certain paints and pigments, explosives, and petrochemicals. There is limited product differentiation within the sector; products are sold for their composition.
The commodities market is highly fragmented. The
end-user markets include other basic chemicals, specialties, and other chemical
products; manufactured goods such as textiles, automobiles, appliances, and
furniture; and pulp and paper processing, oil refining, aluminum processing,
and other manufacturing processes. Markets also include some non-manufacturing
industries. The sector is presently valued at ~USD 3,700 Bn and is expected to grow
at 5%-6% globally in the next five years.

The specialty chemicals market is characterized by high value-added, low volume
chemical production. These chemicals are used in a wide variety of products,
including fine chemicals, additives, advanced polymers, adhesives, sealants and
specialty paints, pigments, and coatings. The specialty market is extremely fragmented.
The consolidation of companies has been a major trend and is expected to
continue. Similar to the commodity sector, the specialty sector is affected by the high costs of energy and feedstock.



Growth Drivers across the Industries
The
COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy.
Chemical companies in North America
and Europe have specifically started focusing on operational efficiency, asset
optimization, and cost management. On a short-term basis, most companies are
considering implementing a series of targeted, strategic initiatives across
major functional areas such as R&D and technology. 
Companies are also keen
on addressing long-term opportunities like investing in innovation, emerging
applications, adopting new business models that generate sustained growth,
analyzing temporary vs. permanent customer buying behavior patterns across geographies.

The industry is expected to see the following trends in the next 2-5 years - 
• Companies
will try and shift their focus toward new value streams and growing end
markets, such as health care and electronics

• Most
governments have announced policy proposals related to regulation, trade, and
sustainability which could prove beneficial in shifting the dependence of the
industry from China

• Chemical companies are now experiencing
significant changes in the way they operate and serve their customers by
leveraging on remote and digital sales channels.


Growth from various Industries are as follows:



Owing to shutdowns in China and lack of capacity
additions in other developed countries, India stands to benefit in the export
market. Also supporting the growth in India is its ability to manufacture at a
lower price compared with its western counterparts. Moreover, the specialty
chemicals consumption in the country is low compared with the global average.
The increasing availability of basic chemicals is likely to support investments
in the specialty chemicals segment further.



The “Make in India” campaign is
also expected to add impetus to the emergence of India as a manufacturing hub for
the chemicals industry in the medium term. Through incentives, subsidies and
grants under this campaign, Indian companies could gain further ground as
companies would want to reduce dependence on China after the COVID-19 pandemic
and shift their supply chains. 


The decline in raw materials prices could also
help the margins and reduce the working capital needs. However, input costs are a
pass-through for most companies and benefits could be limited. Overall, the chemicals industry is likely to continue to perform well in the near
to medium term and is expected to capitalize on the Make in India benefits to
assume a leadership position in the Global markets.

Specialty chemicals are particular chemical products that
help in providing a variety of effects to various industries that they cater to
such as textile, ink additives, construction, oil & gas, cosmetics, and
food. Specialty chemicals can be single-chemical formulations or entities whose
composition greatly influences the performance of the customers’ products. These
chemicals are used on the basis of their function and performance. Continuous
R&D in this market has facilitated the development of products with optimum and
advanced features. This is one of the major factors that drive the growth of
this market.

With the easing of lockdown norms, there has been a good recovery
in overall operations of the Indian specialty chemical sector but it’s believed
that full normalcy would still take some time especially for industrial
chemicals. 

To seize the opportunity to establish India as a
leading chemicals & petrochemicals manufacturing hub, with a thrust on
reduction in import dependency by attracting investments for manufacturing
quality products using cutting-edge technologies in specified clusters with
focus on sustainability contributes to the manufacturing sector of USD 5 Trillion
Indian Economy.


Global Speciality Chemical Market Size



The global Specialty Chemicals market size is pegged at
~USD805b. It is expected to post a ~6.4% CAGR to USD1,170b by CY25. Globally,
~25% of the total specialty chemicals production is exported, amounting to
~USD200b. The EU and the US have historically been key global specialty
chemical hubs. However, after CY08, the focus has shifted to China, facilitated
by lower labor costs, government subsidies, and relaxed environmental norms.
China dominates with ~36% share in the global Specialty Chemicals space, with
exports worth USD35b in CY19 (i.e., ~4x that of India). However, the high
economic growth seen in China has come at a very heavy environmental cost.
Investments in environmental protection have failed to keep pace with the rapid
advancement in the economy. 



China has now issued various environmental protection norms
and taken the necessary steps to ensure a sustainable environment – within
which the economy could grow without damaging the environment. Geopolitical
issues: In Jun’18, the US announced the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports.
This event not only impacted the pricing of goods but also capital spending by
chemical majors. The US-China trade war resulted in supply uncertainties in
western countries. De-risking from a single concentrated source (i.e., China)
presents an opportunity for countries such as India.

India is one of the fastest-growing countries globally -
average GDP growth of 7% in the last 20 years. India’s National Income is growing
at a CAGR of 11%, Will be among the 5 largest world economies by 2025. India
will surpass China and become the most populous country by 2023.

Favorable
demographics – world’s largest youth population. India is on the move: Cities
are likely to house 42.5% of the Indian Population by 2025. Huge domestic market: The urban market shall account for 2/3rd of consumption growth by 2025. Produce
closer to market.

Significant improvements in infrastructure –
ports, roads, airports, railways, telecom. The Ease of Doing Business ranking
of India has improved from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019.



Increase in demand for Chemicals &
Petrochemicals
India is
poised to emerge as a global chemical and petrochemical manufacturing hub. The government of India has launched flagship programs such as Make in India and
the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to provide much-needed support to this sector
and create a facilitative environment to attract further investments.

The
specialty chemicals segment has grown at an impressive rate of approximately
11.7% in terms of value in the last five years. The COVID-19 pandemic had a
positive impact on the demand for flavors and fragrances, personal care
chemicals, nutraceutical ingredients, and surfactants as a result of increased
consumption of hygiene products, packaged foods, energy drinks and
nutraceuticals. The segment has immense growth potential due to the increasing
demand from construction, automotive, packaging, water treatment, home and
personal care, food processing, nutraceuticals, and other demand-driven sectors.



In addition
to the industry’s historic growth trajectory, the Government has taken
progressive steps, such as the economic stimulus package, Production Linked
Incentive (PLI) Scheme, tax and labor reforms, setting up of the National
Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and various chemical industry-specific policies
and schemes, including its public procurement policy, mandatory BIS standards,
skill development programs and renewal of the PCPIR policy.


The Indian chemical industry has tremendous
potential and a positive outlook, and is set to achieve the USD 300 billion
mark by FY25 and emerge as a global manufacturing hub.

Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


In terms of
source, the Indian ethanol market has been categorized into sugar &
molasses-based ethanol, second-generation (mixed grains) and grain-based
ethanol. The energy demand in our country is rising due to an expanding
economy, growing population, increasing urbanization, evolving lifestyles, and
rising spending power. Based on application, the market has been segmented into
industry solvent, fuel & fuel additive, beverages, disinfectant, personal
care, and flavouring & fragrance. The target of achieving 20% Ethanol blending by 2030 has been revised to be achieved by 2025.




About 98%
of the fuel requirement in the road transportation sector is currently met by
fossil fuels and the remaining 2% by biofuels. Today, India imports 85% of its
oil requirement. The Indian economy is expected to grow steadily despite
temporary setbacks due to the COVID pandemic.


Domestic
biofuels provide a strategic opportunity to the country, as they reduce the
nation’s dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, when utilized with
appropriate care, biofuels can be environmentally friendly, sustainable energy
sources. They can also help generate employment, promote Make in India, Swachh
Bharat, doubling of farmers’ incomes and promote Waste to Wealth generation.



This would
result in a further increase of vehicular population which in turn will
increase the demand for transportation fuels. Domestic biofuels provide a
strategic opportunity to the country, as they reduce the nation’s dependence on
imported fossil fuels. In addition, when utilized with appropriate care,
biofuels can be environmentally friendly, sustainable energy sources.


Biofuel Manufacturing Process





Growth in Biofuels
The Indian government announced a multi-year plan to increase the blending of ethanol in
automotive fuel. This was done with the objective of moderating imports and
vehicular emissions. What made the industry sit up and take notice was that
this did not merely entail an announcement of intent it was backed by growing year-on-year
procurement by the country’s oil marketing companies. These oil marketing
companies procured 173 crore litres of ethanol from sugar companies for onward blending
during 2019-20.



Below the table provides the country-wise prices of ethanol:



The prices
of ethanol produced in India are higher in comparison to global players, since
the cost of raw materials viz. sugarcane and food grains are fixed by the
government to support the farming community. Globally, the three major factors
drive the production of ethanol and its usage in the transportation sector,
namely :


1. Demand
Enrichment: Governments’ mandate for blending a minimum percentage (%) of
ethanol with gasoline fuel & production of ethanol compatible vehicles. 
2. Supply
Enrichment: Schemes for ethanol production from different feedstocks and
encouragement to augment bio-refineries and their capacities. 
3.
Incentives: Promoting the use of higher ethanol blends through price incentives
(tax relief at the retail level) and tax incentives for vehicles compatible
with E20 and E85.


Fuel Ethanol Demand in India
Ethanol
(also called ethyl alcohol, or alcohol) is an organic chemical compound with the chemical formula C2 H5 OH. Besides the EBP Programme, ethanol finds competitive
usage in the portable sector and the chemical & pharmaceutical industry.
Demand for ethanol as a fuel is primarily driven by blending mandates, the widespread availability of fuel, and compatible vehicles and fulfilment of
other infrastructural requirements.





Availability of feed-stocks for production of ethanol 
To produce
684 crore litres of ethanol by the sugar industry by 2025-26, sugarcane
equivalent to 60 LMT of surplus sugar would be diverted to ethanol. In the
current sugar season, 2020-21 more than 20 LMT of sugar is estimated to be diverted.
To produce 666 crore litres of ethanol/ alcohol from food grains by 2025-26,
about 165 LMT of food grains would be utilized.
 
At present
damaged food grain availability is around 40 lakh ton in the country. In
2020-21 approximately 20 lakh ton maize is surplus; FCI Rice is also sufficient
in stock (266 LMT) and it will continue to remain robust as procurement of
paddy/rice at MSP continues at expected levels. The country is producing
sufficient food grains and sugar to meet the requirement for ethanol.






Estimation of supply and capacity augmentation 
During
the meeting of the Committee of Secretaries on 13th November 2020, DFPD informed that the
fuel 20% ethanol requirement by 2025 will be met from sugar as well as grains
sectors. The chart below provides the Year-wise and Sector-wise Ethanol Production
Projections as per increasing Blending Percentages.




The
grains and molasses-based ethanol production capacity necessary to meet the
production projections.





The central
government is expecting investments of up to Rs 41,000 crore to help India
achieve its ethanol blending target of 10% by 2022 and 20% by
2025. This investment is likely to arrive as capacity addition
for ethanol-producing distilleries in addition to building new ones.
 
With a view
to achieve blending targets, DFPD is making concerted efforts to enhance the
ethanol distillation capacity in the country. For this, the government had
invited applications from the entrepreneurs under the ethanol interest
subvention schemes in September 2020 during a window of 30 days. Thus far, 238
projects for a capacity enhancement of 583 Cr litres with a loan amount of
about Rs.16,000/- crore have been approved by DFPD. It is expected that at
least 400 Cr litres capacity would be added to these projects by 2024.



There is an estimate that an ethanol demand of 1016 cr. litres based on expected growth in
vehicle population. Modelling exercise on expected penetration of electric
vehicles estimate the ethanol demand for petrol blending in the range of
722-921 crore litres in 2025. Prime Minister mentioned, 5,000 compressed biogas
plants will be set up by 2024 with a production target of 15 million tonnes.

Enablers
for boosting research and innovation and strengthening the entire ecosystem





Government Initiatives
Considering immense growth potential, biotechnology has been chosen as one of the champion
sectors in the Make in India initiative. Funds and infrastructure support have been
committed under the start-up India initiative. To provide for specialized
facilities required for biopharma research and innovation, the government has
established incubators and parks for start-ups. The Department of Biotechnology
(DBT) has set up nine biotechnology parks and incubators that offer facilities
to scientists and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for technology
incubation, technology demonstration, and pilot studies. 


      Biotechnology
Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has supported 50 bio-incubators
across the country since 2014 to nurture the ecosystem. It has also set up four
regional centers to foster and facilitate bio-entrepreneurship and mentor
bio-entrepreneurs for transforming innovative biotech ideas into successful and
sustainable ventures. The Technology Development Board has funded 36 Technology
Business Incubators (TBIs) and Science & Technology Entrepreneur Parks
(STEPs) under Seed Support System for start-ups in Incubators.

Biotech Companies poised with external funding to boost the growth
Overall, there are more than 3,500 recombinant
proteins and antibodies in pre-clinical and clinical trials and launched
treatment. A growing number of molecules in the pipeline are being developed by
small and virtual biotech companies. Those do not normally have the in-house
manufacturing capacity and expertise to bring their candidates to market and
therefore have a higher propensity to outsource.









       Currently, these emerging biopharma
companies constitute approximately 80% of the development pipeline. Biotech
companies are outsourcing more than 70% of their development and manufacturing
service needs to external partners. Among smaller biotechs, this number reaches
between 90 and 100%, as secured funding is used for developing therapies in
preference to building in-house manufacturing for clinical-stage trials. Biotech companies with a strong manufacturing
partner can receive improved funding, setting up a positive feedback loop. VC
funds have also begun to establish their own virtual biotech companies.


Pharma & Biotech Contribution to the Value Chain







      The path from preclinical testing to
approval usually takes a decade or longer, with no promise of success.
According to the Biotechnology
Innovation Organization, approximately one in ten drugs entering
clinical testing ultimately make to the markets. The highest rate of failure
occurs in Phase II, only 31% of drugs proceed to Phase III. 
      
      Of those that make
it to the final Phase III, a little more than half 58% are considered safe and
effective enough for an NDA or BLA submission. From start to finish, only 10%
of the drugs that begin Phase-I reach the market. Despite the low odds, innovative
companies continue to bring new drugs to market every year. India's biotechnology industry has a
promising future with huge opportunities and it seems like an attractive prospect for future private
investments.

economy
Biotechnology companies have developed to form
backbone support to the economy of the nation. The bio-economy includes all
activities related to the production of biomass and the ways in which the
biomass and its residues can be used subsequently.




Introduction to Biotechnology 
There is growing consumer demand for natural
products, low-carbon solutions, and bio-based innovation. Industrial
biotechnology is a key enabling technology for delivering these solutions. At
the same time, there is a huge opportunity for biotechnology aligned with
Agriculture & chemical sectors.


However, in the modern financial
world, biotechnology companies comprise an industry sector collectively known
as the biotech. The research, develop, and produce a wide variety of
commercial products, though most of them focus on medical or agricultural
applications.




Green
Biotechnology (Agricultural Biotechnology) – Huge growth opportunities ahead
Green Biotechnology is the use of
genetically altered plants or animals to produce more environmentally-friendly
farming solutions as an alternative to traditional agriculture, horticulture,
and animal breeding processes.
A
green biorefinery processes (wet) green biomass, such as grass, clover,
alfalfa or immature cereals. The first step involves fractionation of the
green biomass into a nutrient-rich juice “Organic Solution” and a fiber-rich
lignocellulosic press cake. This is typically performed mechanically in a screw
press. Both intermediates are starting points for various valorization pathways.



Green biotechnology has various use of
environmentally friendly solutions as an alternative to traditional industrial
agriculture, horticulture, and animal breeding processes.
Use
     of bacteria to facilitate the growth of plants
Use
     of plants to remove heavy metals such as lead, nickel, or silver, which
     can then be extracted (""mined"") from the plants
Genetic
     manipulation to allow plant strains to be frost-resistant
Use
     of genes from soil bacteria to genetically alter plants to promote
     tolerance to fungal pathogens
Engineering
     of plants to express pesticides
Development
     of pest-resistant grains
Use
     of bacteria to assure better crop yields instead of pesticides and
     herbicides
Production
     of superior plants by stimulating the early development of their root
     systems
Use
of bacteria to get plants to grow faster, resist frost, and ripen earlier.

When pharmaceutical and biotechnology
come concurrently, it results in the betterment of humankind. It works
differently for every patient; the dosages shall be given according to the
patient’s genetic, as prescribed by the doctor.
Biotechnology
for Bio Fuels
Biofuels are alternative fuels made from plant
and plant-derived resources. Biofuels are used mainly for transportation. There
are two types of biofuels: bioethanol and biodiesel.


Bioethanol, the principal fuel used as
substitute for petrol for road transport vehicles is mainly produced by the the sugar fermentation process of cellulose (starch), which is mostly derived from
maize and sugar cane. Biodiesel on the other hand is mainly produced from oil
crops such as rapeseed, palm, and soybean.




Global Scenario
for Growth
In
the year 2020 the global biotechnology market size was valued at USD 752.88
billion and is expected to expand at a (CAGR) of 16% from 2021 to 2028. The
market is driven by favorable government initiatives owing to the growth of the the biotechnology sector in developing countries, such as India and China.



In addition, in 2019, small molecules
dominated the pharmaceutical compounds pipeline with around 22 U.S. FDA
approvals as compared to eight large molecules (biotech). Around 4 out of every
10 drugs are biotech derived, which can be attributed to the growing demand for
orphan drugs and personalized medicine. This is driving the influx of emerging
and innovative biotechnologies companies, further boosting the market revenue.


Rising incidence of persistent conditions such
as diabetes and cancer globally is expected to increase the need for
biotechnology products over the forecast period. It is estimated that diabetes
affected more than 420 million people globally and is expected to rise to more
than 600 million by 2045.

"Ethanol - Demand, Market Size, Opportunities & New Goverment Policies (Part-1)",https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/05/ethanol-demand-market-size.html,2021-05-09T08:30:00.006Z,2021-05-09T08:30:00.006Z,Unknown,"Ethanol - The next big tailwind story
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar
Introduction
Ethanol, also
called ethyl alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol is simple alcohol
that is often abbreviated as EtOH. Ethanol production in India is mainly
dominated by sugary feedstock, and C-heavy molasses available from sugar mills. Ethanol
produced by fermentation of renewable food crops such as sugarcane, maize,
wheat, sorghum, beet, and other starches is called bioethanol, and it is the eco-friendly
alternative biofuel. The product is primarily used as a solvent in various
industries such as:


In addition,
ethanol is gaining popularity as an efficient alternative fuel. It has
significant penetration in the major end-use industries such as automotive,
foods and beverages, chemicals, personal care and cosmetics, and
pharmaceuticals. According to the reports, the global ethanol market is
projected to grow at a robust CAGR of 4.5% to reach USD 117 Billion by the end
of 2027. The primary factors favoring the growth of the global ethanol market are
the increasing demand for the product in the rapidly growing end-use industries
such as automotive, food and beverages, and chemicals.


In Chemistry terms, ethanol or
ethyl alcohol is the 2nd member in the family of molecules
containing OH (hydroxyl) group attached to a carbon atom, with the chemical
formula C2H5OH. This molecule has three widely known
applications –


As fuel ethanol where is mixed
with gasoline as an oxygenate to boost octane number and in higher proportions,
to replace gasoline. As beverage alcohol where is the principal component of
alcoholic beverages like whiskey, rum, and vodka. In industrial applications like
paints, varnishes, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, industrial solvents,s, etc.





Sugar
Process Flow chart



In a fermentation process sugar (glucose, fructose or other monosaccharides) is converted to ethanol by microbes (mostly varieties of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which are inoculated to the feedstock. The monosaccharides originate either directly from disaccharides, which are broken up via invertase enzymes, or from starch which is hydrolyzed with amylase enzymes. In addition to ethanol, water and carbon dioxide are produced also.


The feedstock for ethanol production can be any material containing appreciable amounts of sugar or substances that can be converted to sugar. Conventional production uses sugar (from sugar cane and sugar beet), starch (from corn, wheat, or potatoes), or other polysaccharides. The production process of second-generation ethanol, also called cellulosic alcohol, uses cellulosic feedstock (e.g. from agricultural residues) which requires further pretreatment.


Huge
runaway for Growth
The total annual installed capacity of Ethanol in India is 460 Cr. L In the next 5 yrs, OMCs Ethanol
requirement will be ~2000-2400 Cr. Lts as per 10% Ethanol blending India has a target of achieving 10% Ethanol blending by 2022 & 20% Ethanol blending by
2030.



India has preponed the target of
achieving 20% ethanol-blending with petrol by five years to 2025 as it looks to
cut dependence on costly oil imports. In 2014, less than 1% ethanol was being
blended with petrol against the target of 5%. In the last sugar year, this
ratio has reached 8.5% and next year it is 10%, Last year the government had
set a target of reaching 10% ethanol-blending by 2022 (10% of ethanol mixed
with 90% of petrol) - and 20% by 2030. ""But now the 20% target has been
advanced to 2024-25.

When the nation achieves that ratio of blending,
India will be second only to Brazil in blending ethanol in petrol. But in
absolute terms, India will be higher than Brazil. India is 83% dependent on
imports for meeting its oil needs. Doping petrol with ethanol will cut down the
import requirement. Also, ethanol being less polluting fuel, it will cut down
carbon emissions.

Government Recent Policy
to augment the growth

The government has announced the 5 year tender for procurement. There's a big push
on the ethanol side. High interest for grain-based ethanol plants following the
Government announcements regarding the use of surplus grains. The current
ethanol blending rate in India has reached a level of 5.1% amounting to 200
crore liters in the current year. With the Government’s plan to reach 10% by 2022
and 20% by 2030 there is a significant capacity that needs to be built to cater
to the additional blending requirement by 2022. With a view to achieving blending
targets Government is encouraging sugar mills and molasses-based standalone
distilleries to enhance their ethanol distillation capacity. Based on the
ethanol supply offers, Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have
allocated 325.5 crore liters for Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) (period from Dec. to
Nov.) 2020-21 to be blended with petrol under the EBP Programme.


Source:GIA Research & ISMA
In
fact, to meet the target of 20% ethanol blending, the industry will fall short of
sugarcane and will have to depend on grains too. Distillery margins have been
strong, so despite just 15% revenue contribution, the profit contribution is
more than 50%. Most sugar companies are already working on expanding ethanol
capacity. This will give them the flexibility to shift production between sugar and
ethanol to maximize profitability.

Thus the ethanol distillation capacity in the country
would increase from 426 crore liters per annum to about 590 crore liters per
annum by 2022. To encourage sugar mills to divert excess sugarcane to produce
ethanol for blending with petrol, the Government has allowed the production of
ethanol from B-heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and sugar and has
also fixed the remunerative ex-mill price of ethanol derived from these
feed-stocks. The state-wise targets for ethanol manufacture have also been
fixed.

In order to enhance the ethanol production
capacity in the country, DFPD has informed that Government has notified a the modified scheme on January 14,2021 for extending financial assistance in the
form of interest subvention on loans advanced by Banks/NCDC/IREDA/NBFCs and any
other financial institutions to project proponents for different activities
viz. setting up of new distilleries, expansion of existing capacity,
installation of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) System and Molecular Sieve
Dehydration (MSDH) Column, etc. for production of first-generation (1G) ethanol
from feedstock such as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum), sugarcane
and sugar beet, etc. including granaries and surplus rice with Food Corporation
of India (FCI).

every life, every day


Twitter: shuchi_nahar
The Indian enzyme market is yet to find its feet, as it is quite small when compared to the other sectors in the country. However, the growing awareness about the capabilities of enzymes and the subsequent benefits (both nutrition and cost-wise) will be important growth factors in the coming years. Nature’s enzymes and microbes are at work everywhere – from converting sugar into energy inside your cells, to enabling photosynthesis in the trees and plants outside your window. 


What are Enzymes?
Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts. When one substance needs to be transformed into another, nature uses enzymes to speed up the process. In our stomachs, for example, enzymes break down food into tiny particles to be converted into energy.


Enzymes are used as catalysts to manufacture a variety of everyday products - like sugar, beer, bread, and ethanol. They are also used directly in products such as laundry detergent, where they help remove stains and enable low-temperature washing.


Industrial Enzymes have been used in the food & beverages industry for decades now. They are mainly used in baking, brewing, and food preservation. Microbial enzymes are increasingly preferred over plant and animal enzymes, owing to their high level of stability. 


In specialized enzymes, the polymerases & nucleases are the largest segments whereas in industrial enzymes, carbohydrate, which is a cost-effective and flexible segment, is widely used. Enzymes segment enjoys very high margins compared to other specialty ingredients, as it is a highly research-driven segment and also requires significant time investment before getting approvals for registrations or patents. 


Enzymes are another sunrise industry and are expected to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis as industries keep moving away from synthetic solutions. Along with a better margin profile, enzyme companies claim premium valuations.


Industrial enzymes and specialty enzymes are expected to grow at 6% and 7% CAGR respectively over 2019-25


Source: Global Market Insights


The enzymes industry has very high entry
barriers on account of extensive R&D focus and long gestation period before getting registration approvals for
products in the USA and EU. Most companies are now moving away from synthetic products to eco-friendly solutions and
enzymes is a sunrise industry with significant growth potential across various industries. Therefore,
pure enzyme players claim premium valuations over other companies.

beef, and other protein food has fueled the penetration of enzymes in the
overall food & beverage sector. Escalating demand for nutritional packaged
and processed foods with extended shelf-life has propelled the growth of the enzyme market.

The food enzymes market, at a CAGR of 6.9%, is projected to be valued at
$3.23 billion by 2023. Factors like better food quality, rising demand for
processed food, and increased awareness about nutrition-rich foods have
contributed towards the market’s growth. With the growing demand for
environment-friendly manufacturing processes, the market is primed to shift
towards a path of a promising and sustainable future. 


The industrial enzymes market is valued at $5.9 billion in 2020

In FY19, the Indian enzyme industry was valued at 23.60 billion with a growth rate of 7%. The developments in pharmaceuticals and
chemical sectors will provide a much-needed boost to the enzyme market and it is
expected that the demand for specialty enzymes will be more than the industrial
ones.


The Indian manufacturers are
expanding their market base by exporting their products to a number of
countries. In FY20, on an average per quarter enzymes worth approx. 78.57
crores were exported to the USA, Japan, Germany, and Denmark. With the revival of
the economy, an increase in foreign direct investment will support the industry
and promote the use of enzymes. The government will motivate R&D in
biotechnology to exhibit the nation’s capabilities in terms of pharmaceuticals
and the relevant technology. 

The flourishing food and beverage sector has significantly
fueled the demand for carbohydrates, which are used to catalyze the starch
conversion process. The Asia Pacific is observing high population growth and a
considerable rise in its food & beverage industry base. Japan, South Korea,
India and China are the leading countries that are driving the Asia Pacific
enzymes industry trends. As per estimates, the regional market is anticipated
to show a 9% rate of growth over the period of 2016-2024.

There is a large potential for future enzyme
inclusion, especially in emerging markets. Significant up-dosing and
penetration potential in emerging markets in general and in the Asia Pacific in
particular.

This move will make India an attractive market and companies
will look for inroads for gaining ground. Apart from biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals, enzymes are resourceful in other industries like household
care, food, and beverage, leather manufacturing, animal feed, etc. Better
R&D infrastructure and increased awareness about enzymes and their products
will help in improving the overall market size in India.

income, humanization trends, and rising health and wellness awareness, pet
parents are now more conscious of the kind of products they buy and are
increasingly looking for premium and natural offerings for their pets, which
has drastically increased the need for pet food. 
Indians welcoming more
""paw"" buddies during the lockdown and so on has supplemented by pet
humanization trend among pet parents, demand branded premium offering that will
likely fuel growth over time.


Factors
that drives the trend towards animal healthcare changes in lifestyles,
increased urbanization, nuclear families, single status, few or no children,
and employment stresses are creating a significant need for emotional support.
With more people having to stay indoors for safety the need for companion
animals will grow. However, the growing incidence of zoonotic diseases is a
concern, driving the demand for the companion animal healthcare market.

Indian Chemical Industry – Upcoming Growth Ahead
India’s chemical industry is a global
outperformer in returns to shareholders and remains an attractive hub for
chemical companies. This outperformance has resulted in high expectations for
sustained, continual growth of the industry’s top line and bottom line. The macro perspective on India indicates that while the short-term outlook is
challenging, the country’s long-term growth story remains positive.
Specialty
chemicals are a niche segment of relatively high-value low-volume chemicals,
which are targeted at various applications in specific end-user industries.
According to a recent report by Allied Market Research, the global specialty
chemicals market was valued at USD 711.0 billion in 2019 and is estimated to
reach USD 953.9 billion by 2027 - with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of
5.0%.



Increasing investible opportunities in India 
According to McKinsey report  India’s trade flow in the chemical sector to
identify and better understand investible themes in the domestic industry.
Chemicals are a significant part of India’s overall trade flow, consistently
ranking third in imports and fourth in exports for the past five years.
Today, India has a chemical trade
deficit of USD 15 bn. Analysis of India’s chemical exports and imports, coupled
with a review of opportunities emerging from global trends, suggests two
investible themes: 

Building self-sufficiency in
petrochemicals to plug the domestic supply shortfall of 52% (by volume) in
petrochemical intermediates: Six value chains make up around 77%  of this shortfall, creating an opportunity
worth about USD 11 bn.
Ramping up exports in select areas,
such as specialty chemicals, to obtain a larger share of global value. The
chemical industry already contributes significantly to India’s trade volume.
Capturing emerging opportunities in the near term could make a positive
difference to Indian chemical companies and to the industry overall. Chemicals
rank fourth in imports, after mineral fuels and oils, precious stones and
metals, and electrical machinery, also with a 9% share.

DMCC - Dharamsi Morarji Chemical Company - Company Overview,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2021/02/dmcc-dharamsi-morarji-chemical-company.html,2021-02-27T10:23:00.001Z,2021-02-27T10:23:00.001Z,Unknown,"Dharamsi Morarji Chemical Company - Company Overview
The Dharamsi Morarji
Chemical Company Limited (DMCC), established in 1919, was the first producer of
Sulphuric Acid and Phosphate fertilizers in India. Over the years, the brand of
the Company (“Ship”) came to be recognized as the quality standard for Single
Superphosphate (SSP). Until recently, DMCC was known primarily as a fertilizer
producer, with over 75% of revenue from SSP. As a strategy, DMCC structured
itself to Speciality Chemicals. With focused Research and Development efforts,
processes for downstream sulfur-based chemicals were commercialized.




Diversified
Product & Customer Base
The company has 34 unique products across bulk and
specialty chemicals. The company has a wide product basket that helps us in penetrating
new geographies and acquiring new customers. The chemicals manufactured and
applied in a wide range of industries across 25 countries.


Impact on Bulk Chemicals
Companies  bulk chemicals had an unfavorable market
conditions and earned lower realization as compared to the previous year.
While they maintained their market share, the company did witness a decline in the
topline and bottom line. The company is in good progress with its plans to
debottleneck and expand operations in the Roha facility. The company is also adding
incremental capacity for sulphuric acid in Dahej, which will enable them to tap
new customers as they continue to be cost-efficient in their bulk chemicals
business.


Growth of Speciality Chemicals
Companies specialty chemicals business is progressing
well. Despite facing stiff challenges from Chinese competitors, the company has
managed to maintain strong demand for its products in export markets. Their
strategy going forward is to be a backward integrated specialty chemical
company. With this, their focus will be on strengthening the innovative funnel
to ensure aggressive growth. The company will be going under significant
transformation with an ambitious investment plan in this segment.

Growth in Sales over the years



Financial Performance for Q3FY21
The
revenues of the company in Q3FY21 increased by 16.95% to 47.33 cr. as compared
to 40.47 cr. in Q3FY20. The company recorded a strong overall performance
despite a planned maintenance shutdown of 35 days during the quarter. The
company also witnessed strong demand from the export market during the quarter.
Segment Performance for Q3FY21
The company witnessed a strong performance in the specialty chemicals segment with the reopening of domestic industries. The demand from export markets continued to
remain strong during the quarter despite the 2nd wave of COVID in European
countries. 
The
commodity segment of the boron business continued to face a challenging environment with the availability of raw materials being a roadblock. However, the
company continues to witness traction on the specialty part of the boron
business.
The
volumes in the bulk chemicals business were subdued owing to the maintenance
shutdown. The company expects the volumes in bulk chemicals to recover from the
current quarter.


Capex
to cater to future demands
Bulk
chemicals at Dahej
The company will be investing 50 cr.
in adding incremental capacity in the bulk chemicals segment.
The company has been facing certain
challenges in terms of delays from vendors, however, the company is on track to
complete the project by June 2021.
Specialty chemicals at Dahej 
The company will invest 20 Cr. in a
dedicated plant at Dahej facility. The company will use this facility for
contract manufacturing. The products to be manufactured and other details
remain confidential as the company has signed an NDA. The plant is expected to
begin commercial production in the 2nd half of 2021.
Debottlenecking at Roha 
The company is progressing well on its
plans of debottlenecking at the Roha facility. The company will invest ~ 10 cr.
on this project. The company is on track to complete this project by April
2021.
Multipurpose plants at Dahej 
The company will further invest Rs. 10
cr. in 2 multipurpose plants at the Dahej facility. The company plans to begin
commercial production in these multipurpose plants by the end of the current
financial year.
Intermediates Plant at Dahej 
The company had plans to invest Rs. 20 cr. for
expansion to manufacture intermediates for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical
industry. This project is expected to complete by December 2021 The company had
earlier decided to invest this amount in Sulfones. However, with a downturn in
the international markets for the product category, the plan has been put on
hold. 
Opportunities in
the domestic chemical landscape
The chemical industry already contributes to India’s trade volume.
Capturing emerging opportunities in the near term could make a positive
difference to the Indian chemical companies and to the industry in general. Diversification
of supply chains out of China coupled with stricter environmental norms is
changing the structure of the Chinese chemical industry.


These factors are causing
uncertainty among international players that source chemicals from China. This could create an opportunity for the
Indian chemical players in certain value chains and segments.
Steadily
shepherding the industry towards higher environmental standards, China’s
stricter norms are disrupting some parts of the chemical value chain.
 
Trade conflicts have erupted around the world, especially among
China, the United States, and Western Europe. These have led to shifts in supply
chains, affecting bilateral trade between China and United States, with
possible repercussions for other economies. Large chemical markets that
remain accessible could present opportunities for Indian
chemical companies. Sustainability is becoming an imperative, with various
stakeholders placing a premium on it. The government of China has set
provincial targets and is shutting down non-compliant companies. Chemical
companies that prioritize environmental sustainability while complying with
local regulations may stand to benefit from this opportunity.


Specialty chemicals are the leading Indian chemical export
segment, making up more than half (55%) of total chemical export value in 2018.
Yet they contribute only 3% of the total export value of specialty
chemicals worldwide. Compared to 13% for China, 11% for Germany and 5% for
Japan. There is enough room for growth for companies operating in this segment.


Focus on Research and Development
The company focuses
on the research-led conversion of generic materials into value-added niche
specialty chemicals. The company has been incrementally increasing its spending on
R&D to enhance their process chemistry skills, improve product quality and
process yields of existing products. R&D spend in the financial year ending
March 2020 stood at a life-time high of INR 2.25 cr. which is 40% higher as
compared to the previous financial year. 
With a strong
focus on R&D and 2 manufacturing units, the company is well placed to benefit
from the upcoming industry opportunities.


Creating New Growth Platforms
In 2019 company
broke ground on their upcoming sulphuric acid and specialty chemical plant
spread across 1,03,000 sq. mt. the plot in Dahej. This will further enhance their
sulphuric acid capacity by 300 MT/day and expand their reach to new customers. 
The
company will also add capacities for Benzene Sulfonyl Chloride, Sulfones, and a
range of Thio Compounds. 
The company expects this unit to start by June 2021. With a
planned expenditure of about 50 cr. on the sulphuric acid plant, the company
expects to derive 1.5 - 2x fixed asset turns on this asset. This will be a
one-time investment that will take care of their sulphuric acid needs for the
foreseeable future.

CMS the business has shown a good momentum while the GDS also continues to play an important part in the growth. The driver of this quarter’s CMS uptick has been
the strong performance from the scale-up projects which have contributed to the
revenues. Unit 3 has started commercial production and the company is currently
shipping out 2 API’s from this facility. It's expected that Unit 3 to be a major driver of our growth going forward.

Capacity Expansion Plans to cater opportunities
So currently
for the year 2021, the company is roughly at around 80 crores of investments and
they have a plan to basically evaluate certain CAPEX proposals that are in the
pipeline in the range of 50 to 60 crores in this year. So it depends how a
particular molecule looks like if it makes the attractive business investment.
For the next year also, the company has a similar kind of investment plans because
the business is looking attractive for new propositions.


Future Outlook
Company has
already developed peptides like Linaclotide. The company is efficiently  working on peptides like Liraglutide and
Semaglutide and these are having huge commercial value going forward. These
peptides being fairly complex in nature, the timelines for development for
filing a DMF are longer.


Typical
small molecules take anywhere from 3 to 9 months to file a DMF whereas the
complex peptide-like Liraglutide or Semaglutide could take 2-2.5 years. But
given that the opportunity is fairly large and the company is excited about these
molecules and hopefully, the company is having few interesting partnerships on the
generic peptide side.

Praj HiPurity Systems (PHS)
Praj
HiPurity Systems (PHS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Praj Industries Limited.
PHS offers water systems (WS), modular process systems (MPS) as well as the value
added services (VAS) to customers in biopharma, sterile formulations, topical
& orals, cosmetics & personal care, and nutraceutical industry.


PHS made importantly
progress in the complex injectables, a niche low volume high-cost product segment, which is gaining traction across the globe. The partnership with Aquanova,
of Sweden especially to cater  all important injectables and vaccine industry
is paying dividends. 
Several tops
of the line, pharma majors have reposed faith in this value proposition by way

new investments.



Revenue Trend Over the past 5 Years 


Revenue
Split for Recent Q2 FY21: Rs 260.24Cr.



Global
fermentation champion Novozymes with Indian biotechnology major has an active
collaboration with Praj in India for the past 10 years.


Strong Pipeline to cater to future
demands


Bioenergy
which is the core business of the company clearly see a significant effort from
multiple stakeholders now to make the whole system and the environment and the
opportunity crystallize in terms of the definition of feedstock. 


The demand
from oil marketing companies have now been projected for 5 years through that
and the prices have been rationalized. So, there is a clear move by the
government to tell the sugar mills that over the next 3 years period they will
start to reduce the quota for export and gradually bring it to zero over the
next 3 years and all of that surplus should get diverted to ethanol production.
Even on the other hand if you look at the 2G technology it will be of great
benefit for the company.


On the CBG
front, the company has developed an ecosystem that will be very positive for
setting up the capacities. On the non-Bio-energy side of their business, as mentioned, the company sees clear traction coming out on the zero liquid discharge systems.


The PHS a business that is serving the very important pharma segment, already because of
the uptick in the pharma segment itself plus the success and the durability
of the solutions that the company has built over a period of time, is now leading us to
a situation where customers are looking from a very different perspective on
the PHS's ability to provide solutions. So, all in all, it’s expected the whole
ecosystem to be very positively oriented to build on the order book
performance.

variety of oncology diseases. The acquisition is expected to be completed by January
2021.


LSI Segment 
Within the LSI segment, Speciality Ingredients The business Unit is focused on developing new products. At any point in time,
there are 10-15 new products being worked upon. Specialty Intermediates faced
headwinds due to temporary impact on demand because of the pandemic, while
Nutritional growth was led by price growth and exports to the European market for
Vit-D3 products. 


LSC key product Ethyl Acetate growth was muted due to certain
customer segments viz. Automotive (Paints), Consumer durables (Packaging) and
Electronics sectors are witnessing lower activities during COVID-19.

Revenue

The company expects revenues and profitability in
North America will continue to account for a significant portion of its
future consolidated revenues as the company continue to focus on growth in this
market. New products in the pipeline will lead to major revenue generation in
coming times. Two of their radiopharmaceutical products have received
505(b)(2) approvals from the US FDA, namely Drax ExametazimeTM and RUBY-FILL®
Rubidium Rb82 Generator and Elution System.


In
addition to Drax ExametazimeTM and RUBY-FILL® Rubidium Rb82 Generator and
Elution System, their Radiopharmaceuticals business line is in the process of
developing certain products such as I-131 meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (‘mIBG’) for
which company plans to make a New Drug Application (‘NDA’) filing.

Department of Agriculture (USDA), we have filed our venom products and
allergenic extracts for use in animals. We also have a strong pipeline in our
APIs and Solid Dosage Formulations businesses.

Patents
filed and approved to date





CMO
& Generics – Will led to stronger growth
CMO – New
lyophilization installation in Q1, strong demand from customers as well as new
deals.
Signed five
(one in Q2) separate clinical and commercial supply agreements for Covid-19
treatment and vaccine candidates (sterile injectable).Robust order book and new
business sign-ups.Nanjangud (API) operations started, strong order book.
Expecting 500 crores in revenue over 10-12 months from Covid products. 


Remdesivir
started my contribution. Covid related products - 1 million vials produced.
Generics -
led by strong performance in key products in the US market and by the launch of Remdesivir
in various countries. Roorkee site capacity expansion completed in FY20.
Salisbury site expansion is underway translating to 85% increase in capacity by
February 2021. Remdesivir production capacity increased from 2 lakh vials to
4.8 lakh vials per month.


Pharmaceuticals business segment growth likely to be healthy 
Recent long term contracts in the
radio pharma business, Rubyfill traction in the US coupled with Europe launch are
expected to strengthen specialty sub-segment growth that is likely to grow at
8.6% CAGR in FY20-23E to 3869 crore. 


This is on the back of strong decent
growth in the radiopharmacy business (amid competition) and consolidation of the pharmacy business. The CDMO business was impacted in Q1 due to about two-month the shutdown of its Nanjangud API plant due to Covid (back on track in Q2).


However, going ahead, it's expected
this segment to see strong traction on the back of improving operating
leverage. Generic business is also posting decent growth on the back of base
business besides one-off opportunities. A key monitorable in the segment would be developments on the
five contract manufacturing agreements that the company has signed for Covid
treatment and vaccine candidates. On the LSI front, the performance continues to be
lumpy except for the nutritional sub-segment.


Demerger may complete in FY21
NCLT approval received for demerger: JLS has
recently received the NCLT approval to go ahead with its demerger plan of
having two separate entities for pharma and LSI (Life Science Ingredients)
businesses. The board had initially approved this re-organization of the
businesses in Oct'19 and the approval from shareholders and creditors were
received in Aug'20. Key objectives of this re-organization were: 
1) Have
separate focus business entities, 
2) better management of risks and regulatory
requirements, 
3) enabling strategic growth with optimal capital allocation, and 
4) unlocking of shareholder value.

growth over the medium term.


Impact
on Demand of Syringe –Beneficial for
the Company in Long-run




The
estimated demand in India would be around 900 million pieces of different kinds of
syringes for just one shot of the vaccine, considering 60-70% of
the country gets vaccinated.""The number would amplify to 1.8 billion if the
vaccine India chooses to needs two shots. Looking to such a spike in demand for
syringes.




Management
said that their company's insulin syringe is frequently used during vaccinations and
the company has offered this product to the Government for the Covid-19 vaccination
drive. He added that many other companies are making similar products
and that the government should start the procurement process for syringes as
early as possible. He said that the Covid-19 vaccine will soon arrive in the
market.



Management
said that the government may soon give permission to 3 or 4 companies to start
manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines in India. He averred that Poly-Med will need a syringe, needle cutter, and cold chain products which will be required to
transport the vaccine. Management revealed that the company has
decided to raise Rs 400Cr out of which Rs 150 to Rs 200 cr will be used
by the company to take the benefit of the PLI Scheme. Management said in the next 5 to 7

Enzymes
are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions and thus often replace chemicals
in products and industrial productions. Biotechnology could be traced back to
thousands of years ago when humans started to use yeasts to make liquor. This
may be the first dawn of biotechnology in food production. Along with the
development of natural and social sciences, nowadays, biotechnology carries more
colorful meanings.


Indian Enzyme Market


The Indian enzyme market is yet to find its feet, as
it is quite small when compared to the other sectors in the country. However,
the growing awareness about the capabilities of enzymes and the subsequent
benefits (both nutrition and cost-wise) will be important growth factors in the
coming years. 


The
developments in pharmaceuticals and chemical sectors will provide much-needed
boost to the enzyme market and it is expected that the demand for specialty
enzymes will be more than the industrial ones. The number of major players in
this market in India is nearly 25, but most of them are into formulations or
marketing. The Indian manufacturers are expanding their market base by
exporting their products to several countries. In FY20, on an average per
quarter enzymes worth 78.57 crores were exported to the USA, Japan, Germany, and Denmark.

Probiotics and its Predominant Role in COVID-19,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/11/probiotics-and-its-predominant-role-in.html,2020-11-21T11:27:00.002Z,2020-11-21T11:27:00.002Z,Unknown,"What are Probiotics and it's Predominant Role
in COVID-19


Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar


1.     Meaning of Probiotics
Probiotic
bacteria have become increasingly popular during the last two decades as a
result of the continuously expanding scientific evidence pointing to their
beneficial effects on human health. As a result they have been applied as
various products with the food industry having been very active in studying and
promoting them. 


Within this
market the probiotics have been incorporated in various products, mainly
fermented dairy foods. In light of this ongoing trend and despite the strong
scientific evidence associating these microorganisms to various health
benefits, further research is needed in order to establish them and evaluate
their safety as well as their nutritional aspects.


2.     Importance of Probiotics w.r.t COVID-19
The typical clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2
infection include dry cough (67%), fever (88%), fatigue (38%), myalgia (14.9%),
and dyspnea (18.7%). Other symptoms include headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea,
and gastrointestinal symptoms. Pneumonia appears to be the most common and
severe manifestation of the infection. Currently, there is no vaccine or
specific drug for COVID-19.  In addition to the SARS-CoV2, avian
influenza, ebola, dengue, and Zika viral infections remain poorly controlled
around the world.


The live microbes, which possess health benefits
on the host when administered in appropriately adequate amount, are referred to
as probiotics and it includes a number of genera of bacteria and yeasts.
Probiotics include Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus,
and Enterococcus.  Probiotics play a role in
balancing the host defensive immune response, thereby stimulating mucosal
barrier function and modulating the immune system. 


3.    
Probiotic as Immune Enhancers
Probiotics exert several health beneficial effects
to the host by several potential systems through the local immunity (by keeping
up gut wellbeing and gut wall integrity) and systemic immunity (by enhancing
specific and non-specific immune system). The application of probiotics is
efficient and competent for several ailments, including viral infections.



Source: Appl Microbiol Biotechno

The mechanism involved upon host infected by
COVID-19. Pro inflammatory cytokines and interferons are released, and viral
cellular translation is suppressed to induce viral clearance as a part of the
host immune response and an antiviral state in adjacent epithelial cells. Viral
clearance occurs in lung and gut epithelium depending on the immune status of
the host. However, probiotic consumption improves.



4.     Gut
Microbiota





The
microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses, and protozoa) in the
human Gastrointestinal tract, lungs, skin, and mouth exist in a commensal relationship with
host cells, thereby playing a major role in human health. The commensal
bacteria that are present in the GI tract are equivalent to the number of human
cells. This colonization starts shortly after birth and their profiles and
numbers stabilize by the age of 1 year with more than 1000 bacterial species. 


The
GI microbiota has the ability to interact with human cells, including specific
immune cells. These interactions produce different health benefits in the host
including regulating GI motility activating and destroying toxins.  Probiotics are also usually recommended for
patients who have recently used antibiotics for treating any disease. Other
causes of dysbiosis in the human GI tract include exposure to toxins, stress,
disease, insufficient diet, and age. 


5.     Lung Microbiota and Respiratory Infection
As compared with the
lower gastrointestinal part, the lungs contain about 10 to 100 bacteria per
1000 human cells that is relatively less bacterial biomass. Probiotics mainly
colonize in the gut, but it has a fundamental impact on the systemic immune
responses. It can also colonize and exert the immune responses at distant
mucosal sites, including the lung.



6.     Gut-lung
axis and COVID-19 
The
gastrointestinal tract and lung are among the body compartments that host
microbiota  however, the lung has a small
number of microbiota when compared to that of the gut. In addition to the most
frequently described respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough and severe
respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 infection, it has also been reported
that patients exhibited GI symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, loss
of appetite, GI bleeding, and abdominal pain. 


Prebiotics
may also have an excellent potential effect against COVID-19 by enhancing
probiotics growth and survivability. Furthermore, prebiotics could have a
direct effect on GI symptoms caused by COVID-19 via blocking the ACE enzymes.


SARS-CoV-2
is a newly emerging virus that currently lacks curative treatments and
vaccines. To date, no study has reported the use of prebiotics and probiotics
to treat or prevent COVID-19, but the use of probiotics in the clinical
treatment or prevention of COVID-19 could be a suitable strategy. So far,
several registered trials that aim to investigate the efficiency of probiotics
in treating COVID-19 patients are ongoing. 


7.    
Future Augurs Well for Probiotics
With a growing
bank of scientific research behind it, the probiotics category is
understandably booming. According to recent figures, the market is expected to
reach $7.1 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 7.8%.


The global
probiotics market size was estimated at USD 48.38 billion in 2018 and is
anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. It is
driven by the growing consumer inclination towards preventive healthcare in
conjunction with the development of efficient probiotic strains.


8.    
Reason
for growth in Probiotics due to COVID
Probiotics are
the potential candidates which need to be tested more often in moderate and
severe cases of COVID-19 due to several beneficial effects, including easy
availability, easy to administer, safety, and cost effectiveness. 


Probiotics –
targeting the pathophysiological processes in the context of COVID-19
infections, are one of the strategies that exert beneficial effects by
manipulation of the gut microbiota, activation of mucosal immunity, and
modulation of the innate and adaptive immune response.


9.     Antiviral effects of Probiotics
Probiotics may
act as antiviral agents by interfering with the entry of the virus into host
cells and/or inhibiting viral replication. This may lead to a reduction in the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract and gut. In addition, with the
restoration of the gut and respiratory microbial harmony, immune function, and
gut-lung axis, the course of COVID-19 may be altered. 


Most of the
probiotic strains are generally safe even in the vulnerable patient groups and
in-hospital care settings, including neonates, children, and adults. Many
probiotic strains have indicated even beneficial effects in these settings. 


10.     Replacement of pharmaceutical agents
provides a major opportunity for probiotics
The increasing
demand for probiotics has shown that customers are preferring products with
proven benefits. The increased evidence of health benefits associated with
probiotics for health restoration has increased the customer expectations
related to probiotics for health curing functions. This inclination toward a
safe, natural, and cost-effective substitute for drugs has led the application
of probiotics as pharmaceutical agents.


Beneficial
effects of probiotics as pharmaceutical agents seem to be strain-and
dose-dependent. Clinical trials have displayed that probiotics may cure certain
disorders or diseases in humans, especially those related to the
gastrointestinal tract.


11.     Health Benefits Associated with
Probiotics Fortified Food is A Major Driver for The Market
Health awareness
among consumers is on the rise and most consumers are constantly in search of
healthy food products for consumption. Probiotics have proven strong benefits
related to health, more specifically to the human digestive system. 


Probiotics are found in supplement
form or as components of foods & beverages. Their integration with
inexpensive health foods, such as yogurt, fruit juices, and cultured dairy
drinks has contributed to a significant market size. 


The most commonly
used bacteria include Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli,
which are found in various dairy products, including yogurt. In the dairy
category, yogurt is the most popular option for consumption of probiotics.


12.     High R&D costs for developing new
probiotic strains is a major restraint for the probiotics market
Probiotics
applications are linked with health benefits, which make it challenging for
manufacturers to get an adequate return on investments on high initial
investments. Research is needed to
determine the accurate mechanisms of action of probiotics against coronaviruses
including SARS-CoV-2 in healthy or infected animal models. These studies may
lead to a better understanding of the bacterial dynamics in the GI tract. 


Animal
or human studies could be used to assess the direct effects of intranasal
probiotics through targeting pathogens in the lungs and indirect effect
occurring through the modulation of immune activity. These studies may be
helpful for treating viral infections such as COVID-19.

13.    
Probiotics Market Segment




14.     Top Impacting Factors
for Growth in Probiotics

1)     Growing Health Concerns due to Novel Coronavirus
2)     Rising Consumption of functional food
3)     High awareness among consumers after Covid-19
4)     Stringent Government Regulations
5)     Increasing R&D Cost

has filed another Agro product (undisclosed) recently. Overall, the management
expects this segment to contribute ~10-15% of overall revenues 2-3 years
down the line. The Investment is done for following purposes. 
·       Veda - to get insight of agrochemical
distribution.
·       OMRV - for getting an understanding
of the hospital space.
·       AACT - for oncology drug discovery. 
     
      3. Key
Products in the Portfolio
     







Para-IV Filing Products in The Pipeline about
to get Approvals and Launch in next few Years. 







       
       Focused
approach in US Natco has carved out its own identity via tie-ups to tap limited
but niche products pipeline including 20 Para IVs filings (FY20). As per the
revised and more feasible game plan, it plans to market products via tie-ups
with established players in the generic space.





      Till FY19,
the company had filed 51 ANDAs, which includes some niche FTF opportunities.
Overall, the management expects one or two complex product launches in the US. 


     4. New Launches
in CND/Oncology to Drive Domestic Revenues 


     Natco is a
leading player in the domestic oncology segment with a product basket of
33 products (FY20). Company expect momentum in oncology segment to
continue on the back of incremental launches amid pricing pressure in some
products. New launches in cardio/diabetology segment (CND) is also expected to
support overall growth. Going ahead, the company is looking to launch six to
eight products a year.
     The
company has launched around 5 products in Q1FY21 and plans to launch
cumulatively 10-12 products in FY21 domestically. R&D productivity is lower amid
Covid-related challenges. The company has adequate capacity for Oseltamivir
across two sites (one in India, another in US). Good pipeline of oncology
products. Focusing on chemistry-based molecules as opposed to monoclonals (mAb).


      5. Products
That Will Drive Future Growth 


      Driven by 3-4
products such as Copaxone, Doxil, Lanthanum carbonate. Export growth due to
stocking of two main Covid products. Oseltamivir + chloroquine (Lower margin
products). API growth also led by demand for these APIs. Agrochem – 10-15% of
revenues over next two to three years.


      Niche high
value – 3 registered (1 being CTPR), some in pipeline (a) CTPR can be launched
in the Rabbi season depending on court rulings and approvals. Commodity
products – more than 6 filed. Over the next 2-3 years domestic agro business to
grow significantly, maybe start exports. Over 30% market share in Copaxone. Non-US
subsidiaries contributing ~12-13% to consolidated earnings.
       
     6. Revenue Growth
Trend over the Years
      


      
      7. What Makes Natco Face in the Crowd?


       Differentiated
model - Natco
followed a different path for the US market – targeting select opportunities
with limited competition translating into high margins and generating
significant cash flows.



The product
portfolio is focused on complex products or litigation related opportunities.
Natco’s successfully delivered four key opportunities Tamiflu, Doxil, Fosrenol, Copaxone which the company commercalized through its partners over
a 11-month period from Dec-2016 to Oct- 2017.


8. US Filings
Summary in Brief 


Company has mapped
16 product filings. These products fall into three categories: 
(a)
Opportunities with case settlements and reasonably clear launch timelines - Revlimid March-2022, Kyprolis 2027, Nexavar (likely launch post Jan-2020). 
(b) Filings,
which in their assessment are not lucrative anymore: Zytiga, Sovaldi, Tarceva. 
(c) Filings
which are diffecult to assess, where outcome is dependent on the court verdict
- Pomalyst, Tracleer. In terms of timelines, Afinitor and Nexavar should be
watched.


Revlimid
- The next big US
approval will be Revlimid while there are handful of other US approvals and
launches lined up. In Canada, the trial for Revlimid commenced in July.
Regarding the US filing, the company has responded to all the queries raised by
USFDA and incremental inspection is not expected. The management is hoping for
a positive news by next quarter.

and Development – Place where Innovation Happens


Company has
over 40 R&D laboratories in 2 research and development facilities with a
talent pool of over 500 scientists. Company is having capabilities span
synthetic chemistry of small molecules, peptide chemistry, oligonucleotides,
nanopharmaceuticals and new drug discovery. R&D productivity was lower in FY20 amid Covid-related
challenges. 






10. Segmental
Overview for the FY 20



Domestic
business: The
domestic business was severely impacted as the Oncology and Hep-C businesses
were affected due to lower demand from patients. The management has
guided for 8-10 product launches in FY21 given the current
situation. On a longer-term horizon, the guidance is 10-12
launches per year. 


Oncology
business -  NATCO’s product portfolio is among the
most extensive in the Indian oncology market, with 33 active products as on
31st March, 2020. The business was down as immunosuppressed cancer
patients can be highly vulnerable to Covid-19, leading to fewer hospital
visits. The oral oncology business (contributing 65-70% to Oncology business)
is coming back but chemotherapy business (contributing 30-35% to Oncology
business) is yet to be back as the hospital visits are still sparse. 
Pricing
pressure is seen easing in this year which was there in 2019. EBITDA margin of
the Oncology business is higher than consolidated company EBITDA margin. The
Company’s revenues from this business segment fell from 3,968 million in FY
2018-19 to 3,078 million in FY 2019-20, primarily due to certain macro
pressures.
Export
business - The
exports (including FDFs and APIs) to the US clocked revenue of 7,834 million
in FY 2019-20. NATCO is positioned strongly in its business in the US, which is
primarily driven by the continued growth of revenue coming from Glatiramer
Acetate and Liposomal Doxorubicin.
The export
business is growing and is offsetting the underperformance of the domestic
business. The business has grown due to company having Chloroquine and
Oseltamivir in portfolio, growth in oral oncology and stocking up due to Covid-19
pandemic. 
API - For over two decades, Company has
demonstrated technical and operational expertise in developing and
commercialising more than 40 niche APIs. Company’s key therapeutic domain is
oncology and company is extending  expertise
to include CNS and pain management. 49 Cumulative DMFs filed 39 Active
DMFs. 
Revenues
from the API division during FY 2019-20 stood at 3,552 million as compared to 3,019 million in FY 2018-19. As of 31st March, 2020, NATCO has a total
of 49 active DMFs with the USFDA for products in the areas of oncology,
cardiology and orthopaedic therapies. Company filed for four DMFs for the US
market in FY 2019-20. 


Agrochemicals
business: NATCO has forayed into the agrichemical space through its
Crop Health Sciences Division recently. Currently it is in the process to
complete the manufacturing facilities for both technical (active ingredient)
and formulations. 
The company
has filed 1 product and approval takes roughly 10-12 months. The company will
be adopting a similar business model to what it does in the pharma division and
challenging patents will also be a part of business strategy. 


China - The company has 4-5 filings under
review in China and couple of approvals are expected in the current fiscal
year. 


11. Capital
Expenditure – To Cater the near-Term Demand


During the
year, Company incurred capital expenditure of 3,492.85 million, a majority of
which was used to enhance capabilities in Company’s manufacturing facilities. A
significant portion of this capex was done at their Vizag facility. The
remaining part was primarily used in formulation facilities across the country.

the facility should support longer-term earning growth prospectus. Also,
Branded formulation and Biologics segment (impacted by COVID-19) will recover
gradually.

Figure:1 Graph Showing Revenue Trend & Revenue Breakup
2. India
formulations growth core to overall growth

 Domestic
formulations (~63% of FY20 revenues) grew at 6.5% CAGR in FY16-20. The subdued
growth can be attributed to high concentration of acute therapies and one of
the lowest MR productivities. With a market share of ~0.7% and overall rank of
29, the company is still a marginal player with some top brands in smaller
categories like stemmatological.


3. Exports
formulations slowly - back on track

 Exports formulations
(~27% of overall FY20 sales) have de-grown at 6.6% CAGR in FY16-20,
undone by regulatory hurdles in developed markets. However, recent clearance
from the UK-MHRA and lifting of warning letters from the USFDA for Goa plant II
and III (plant I is still under warning letter) is likely to improve operating
leverage for export formulations.

start late as vendors will not be ready with orders in July (the initial
timeline).
5) Capacity expansion of Vizag facility

    Sequent claims the Mahad site as the
world’s largest facility making a widely used antiparasitic agent. API revenue grew at CAGR of 56% over FY17-20 on the back of strong
volume growth of 35% during the same period. Given the strong demand outlook,
the company is expanded Albendazole capacity by 33% which will provide strong
headroom to tap growing demand for the product.
     SSL has a capacity of 225 KL at Vizag and are in the process of expanding the same to 350 KL. This

6) Carlyle
Group – To drive Growth in Future

has strong healthcare side with investments around the world. The Carlyle group
will help the company in fast-tracking growth in the US and China. Key benefits
also include higher networking and better talent acquisition.

Mumbai-headquartered animal health care company Sequent Scientific for over Rs
1,500 crore.
•       The
transaction is being done through an equity purchase stake that values each
share at Rs 86. The deal will be executed through two investment vehicles — CA
Harbor Investments, affiliated entity of Mauritius, which is an
affiliated entity of Carlyle. 
•  The Carlyle Group
has entered into a definitive agreement with the existing promoters of Sequent
Scientific to acquire a majority stake and up to 74% in the company, including
up to 26% equity shares from public shareholders. 
•     This is an
inflection point in the journey of the company as a Sequent can now leverage
Carlyle's global network and resources to move to the next bit of growth and
innovation. 
•  Carlyle is no
stranger to the Indian healthcare market, with a history of investing in the
healthcare sector, both in India and globally, fuelled by deep understanding of
the market, and an ability to create value through its operational expertise
and close partnership with management. 
•     This transaction

      b. Growth –
Formulations







    New multi-dosage R&D facility established
in Mumbai to build regulated market pipeline 10 new filings in US in next 3
years. First time capabilities established to execute Ecotoxicity and Bio
Equivalence studies in India First US injectable filed in FY20 for world’s
largest animal health injectable product. 
       The first injectable was launched in the European markets and the
same is expected to be launched in the US in FY22. The company currently does
not have a direct presence in the US, which it is looking to build through
acquisition which will be helped by the Carlyle group deal. Filed world’s
largest animal injectable product in EU and US with an addressable global
market of ~USD 350mn.




Geographical
Scenario





US business: The Company expects the pipeline in the US to
fructify from FY22 to FY24. All deliverables are on the API side and hence
growth in the API business will be driven by the US business. After 18 months,
the company will start launching formulations in the US with the launch of the
blockbuster injectable project.
Europe business: The European business grew 2.2% (CC), which
represents growth in line with the broad market. The injectable product will be
launched in 11 European geographies by the end of November this year. In
geographies like France, where the company doesn’t have a strong presence, the
company will launch injectable both individually as well with partner. The
competitive intensity for the product should be mild with about 3-4 players. 
Turkey market: The Turkey business showed a 66.9% growth in
FY20, which signifies that the regulatory issues are behind.
8) Well
established relationship with Global Majors 
       SSL’s
customer profile consists of global majors across both animal and human health
segments. Under the veterinary segment, the company continues to supply its
products to 8 out of the top SSL’s customer profile consists of global
major’s animal health companies including Zoetis Inc, Merck Animal Health,
Bayer Animal Health, Virbac, Ceva, Vetoquinol, Boereinger Ingelheim, etc. 
       By virtue of
its large customer base, the company’s customer concentration is moderate
thereby mitigating the risk of order volatility. Established relationships with
a wide base of customers coupled with the regular addition of customers have
supported the healthy revenue growth of the company over the years. 
      Going
forward, the company’s customer concentration is likely to reduce on the back
of the company’s efforts to enter into newer products across segments in
addition to catering to new customers across geographies.  
9) Extraordinary
presence across the Globe 
       Company has
steadily built a diversified portfolio of 1,000+ finished dosage formulations
(FDF) across 12 dosage forms. Their therapeutic segments include feed supplements,
antibiotics, anthelmintics, antibacterial, skincare (dermatology) products and
disinfectants with more products in the pipeline. Company is market leaders in
segments like intra mammaries, spot-on and pour-on.

Neuland is a leading manufacturer of active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and an end-to-end solution provider for the
pharmaceutical industry’s chemistry needs. The Company operates in the market
using two main business models - Generic Drug Substances (GDS) where they cater
to the needs of the Generic players and Custom Manufacturing Solutions (CMS)
where they primarily work with innovators by helping them bring critical
products to the market. CDMO is the emerging growth segment of the company with
13 to 17 Molecules in development phase.

Business Performance
Neuland
lab (NLL) has posted revenue of INR 2,054mn with 13.5% YoY increase, which was

molecules (Development + Commercialize) with speciality API segment, which grew
by 33.2% in Q1FY21. EBITDA margin expanded by 622bps to 16.5% level, which was
219bps higher than our estimate driven by 580bps improvement in gross margin
led by improved product mix. 
Management
is confident to improve margin profile from current level on the back of strong
order book in CMS business, better traction in GDS business and cost
optimization measures. In terms of emerging CDMO player Company has couple of
molecules go up from 13 to about 17 in the development Phase-and from 14 to
about 15 in our commercialization phase. Some of these molecules are generating
part of the growth & some of the revenue growth is also coming from the
increase in the number of projects itself. Most of the molecules are in their
last phase of approval, that means there are more chances of approvals coming
in years. API & CMS both have healthy pipeline for future growth.

It’s expected
the contribution from the high-volume segment to be gradually replaced with the
CMS segment and to register healthy revenue growth of 26.6% over FY20-22,

optimistic about the growth of CMS business.











9.    
Future
Outlook
There is a lot of traction on the CMS new projects as well as good growth
in the baseline of the CMS business which is the traditional whole CMS company
had for several years. 
The outlook remains positive especially because the two markets that Neuland
is focusing on Japan and North America and their pipeline of opportunity looks
quite strong the pipeline of projects that have entered the system in the last
3 to 6 months are quite advanced in nature, like say 3 molecules are about to
get into commercial. 
These are opportunities which have a shorter cycle for commercialization.
So, unlike say 4-5 years ago, where the company was mostly engaged in phase I,
phase II projects now they are all in the last phase and they would go through
a natural attrition and a long cycle.

1. What are the trends impacting the global pharmaceutical sector?





2. How are Biosimilars different from Small Molecules?



Figure 1: Comparison of Small Molecule and Biosimilars



Figure 2: Molecule Size - Small Molecules to Biologics


3. Procedure for Biosimilar US FDA Approval 


Biologics contain active substances derived from living cells or organisms, the development of a biosimilar is much more complex than the process for developing a generic drug. A biosimilar requires the creation of a new manufacturing process and a custom cell line since the reference product’s manufacturing process is proprietary and not publicly available. 

Due to the complex nature and production methods of biologics, relatively minor changes in manufacturing processes may significantly affect product quality, safety, and the criteria by which similarity is determined.

*Below (Figure 3) is just an illustrative example for the approval procedure of Pegfilgrastim biosimilar, which gives an idea about the time required for a biosimilar to develop and reach the markets.

A biosimilar may require more analytical characterization and nonclinical studies than reference products, it may need fewer clinical trials and clinical pharmacology studies than its reference product to obtain FDA approval. Due to this reliance on the FDA’s previous finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, a biosimilar may have a shorter and less costly development program.

4. Evolution of Biosimilars and their approvals in US market in last few years
Since the first biosimilars entered the US marketplace in 2015, 28  products have been approved to date. The US marketplace is poised to welcome many new biosimilars from 2019-2022, spurring competition that will potentially lead to significant savings for the healthcare system. Essential components of provider and patient use of biosimilars include addressing the clinical, operational, and economic considerations to drive adoption as well as payer coverage.





Figure 4: Evolution of Biosimilars and rising approvals

Biosimilars have a bright future if additional work is done to be attractive to prescribers and payers. Trends show that providers are already aware of biosimilars and are interested in learning more about them. Similarly, payers are showing a desire to adopt biosimilars to foster a successful marketplace and realize savings. From the above chart, we can see the evolution in Biosimilar approvals that have accelerated in past years and will continue for the Long term in the future. This thesis can be supported by the below (Figure: 4) that shows the increase in biotechnology % Prescription & OTC Sales.

Worldwide Prescription Drug & OTC Pharmaceutical Sales


Figure 5: Biotech vs. Conventional Technology

Biotechnology products are forecast to take the majority share in the top 100 drugs by sales by 2026, with 55% of the total top 100 product sales in 2026, up 16% compared to 2012. Global prescription sales of biotech products to grow with a CAGR of 9.6% between 2019 & 2026, compared to conventional product growth of 5.5%. Biotech products are forecast to take a 55% share of the total top 100 product sales in 2026. The above chart justifies the increasing trend of biotechnology in coming years whose evolution has already started from the year 2017 onwards.

5. Opportunities & Market Size for Biosimilars
The global biosimilars market size is expected to grow by $240 billion by 2030. In today’s emerging markets, biosimilars are still nascent, with little presence.


However, in contrasting emerging markets with developed markets, the limited patient access
to affordable biologics and the openness of physicians to low-cost therapies may offer potentially significant opportunities.



The industry continues to shift towards 
Biotechnology



Figure 6: Worldwide Prescription Drug & OTC Sales by Technology (2012-2026) 
Source: Evaluate Pharma -World Preview 2020

As the number of prescription drugs expected to rise from $940bn (FY20) to $1432 bn (FY26), there is a positive outlook for biosimilars. The FDA appears to recognize the need to evolve standards over time. As biosimilar manufacturers and regulators gain experience and confidence, and technology advances, this kind of flexibility – grounded in science – will be important for fostering a thriving US biosimilars market. A maximally streamlined development, application, and approval process will be all the more vital for biosimilars of orphan or small-market biologics. 

Developed markets, with the exception of the United States, represent the greatest biosimilars presence today Most biosimilars manufacturers have been and remain focused on the developed markets – whether it is for their historic and current opportunities (EU) or for their future market potential (United States, Japan). 


7. The greatest evolution for the pharma sector
More importantly, biosimilars and their originator products accounted for $40 billion in spending in 2019. This expenditure was across several key therapy areas where further biosimilar entry would significantly impact healthcare costs. Biosimilars have the potential for substantial system savings. Therefore, biosimilars spending is expected to reach $16-36 billion by 2024


Source: Biocon Ltd. Annual Report
The recent upsurge in approval and launches of biosimilars, mainly in oncology, has boosted biosimilar penetration. Besides, small molecules continue to play a significant role in innovative treatments in oncology, diabetes, respiratory and autoimmune diseases and represent close to 60% of the total medicine spending compared to biologics.
 
There are listed Indian companies that have shown remarkable progress in biosimilars and have an exponential pipeline for the same that will result in good fortune in the coming times. To name the few they are:

Biocon - U.S, Europe and ROW

Lupin - Europe

Dr. Reddy’s - Domestic Market

Cadila Healthcare - Domestic Market

Syngene (CRO,CDMO & Biologics) - U.S, Europe and ROW

What is Nutraceuticals?



The term ‘nutraceuticals’ was firstly used in the late 1980s to describe food products that have a medicinal benefit. This fast-growing sector includes functional foods (such as vitamin-enriched products), nutritional supplements, sport drinks, and medically formulated foods. 


Nutraceuticals and its Division



Figure 1: The diagram showing the various divisions of Nutraceuticals 



Scope



Nutraceuticals is expected to play a central role in preventative healthcare. The logic seems simple - an ageing population gives rise to lifestyle-related diseases, whose impact can be lessened by making healthier choices earlier in life. This convergence of medicine, food and technology is likely to create a battleground in which food and pharma companies compete for dominance of the sector. Successful companies will have to hit the bullseye in six main areas: technology, product strategy, compliance, marketing, supply chain management and corporate deal-making.



Food and Pharmaceutical Company having different Edge over each other



Food companies have a greater understanding than pharmaceuticals of nutrition and food formulation, plus decades of consumer research and relationships with mass-market distributors. 


Pharmaceutical companies have strong research departments, stakeholder relationships and regulatory structures that enable them to generate new compounds, plus wider ties to the scientific community. Among the pharmaceutical companies with a strong presence in nutraceuticals, Abbott owns some of the leading nutritional product brands. Pfizer sells a range of dietary supplements. Johnson & Johnson makes products to lower cholesterol and dietary supplements for people who are lactose intolerant. The progress done by pharma companies is much faster than the food , due to enriched R&D facilities with the pharma companies.




Nutraceuticals gives an Exciting Opportunity to both Food & Pharmaceutical Companies



By complementing each other’s strengths (and weaknesses), a merger of the nutraceuticals portfolios of a big food company and a big pharmaceuticals company might make sense, but there hasn’t been a significant one yet. While both the company forays into nutraceuticals they can have benefits in themselves such as : 





Figure 2: Opportunities for Pharmaceutical Companies & Food Companies



India’s Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals Market – An Overview


Source: Deloitte Nutraceutical Report
Figure 3: India Nutraceutical Market Growth till 2022 (USD Billion)


The term ""health supplements and nutraceuticals” is evolving and the nomenclature varies across countries. For e.g., Canada naming them natural and non-prescription health products, the USA calling them dietary supplements and Japan naming them “foods for special health use”. 


This has resulted in different countries including different categories for defining “health supplements and nutraceuticals”.While the Indian market witnessed high growth rates in nutraceuticals, it is still a relatively small market global nutraceuticals industry. 


Indian nutraceuticals market constitutes nearly 2% of the global nutraceuticals market. It is expected to grow rapidly and account for 3% of the global share by 2022. Developed countries, including the US, Europe and Japan account for more than 90% of the global nutraceuticals market.



Key Demand Drivers Leading to need and Growth of Health Supplements and Nutraceuticals in India






Figure 4: Key Drivers for growth in Nutraceuticals in India



Elderly Population

Elderly population in India is expected to reach 143 million by 2021 from the current 100 million. With an ageing population, the chronic disease burden has also increased. India recorded 5.8 million deaths owing to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) in 2016, constituting 61% of total deaths.



Rapid Retail Growth

India’s retail market is expected to double to US$ 1.3t by 2020 from US$600b in 2015. Increasing the number of supermarkets, health and wellness chains, etc. would increase the consumer's accessibility to nutraceutical products. A greater number of non-grocery retailers, such as drugstores, mass merchandisers and retail chains, etc. are expanding their selection in the food supplement space.



Trend of Co-Prescription

Penetration of functional F&B remains significantly lower when compared to developed economies of the world providing significant room for opportunity. In India, a multivitamin product is prescribed in 16% of the prescriptions. Multivitamins are increasingly being co-prescribed in indications such as chronic alcohol liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, stroke, sepsis among others.
With the increasing penetration of modern forms of retail including hyper and supermarkets, eCommerce channels, etc., the distribution landscape for functional foods & beverages is changing rapidly.



Change in Consumption pattern & Urbanization  

Focus on fitness and general well-being is leading consumers to intake food products that cater to their additional specific requirements such as proteins, antioxidants, vitamins, etc. With a rising urban population in India (33% in 2015, up from 27% in 1995) the consumption pattern has also changed in the nutraceuticals market. The traditional dietary supplements dominant market is now driven by functional foods. 



The emergence of New Categories in Health & Wellness Space

There is an emergence of new niche categories such as anti-ageing, energy-boosting, skincare, digestive care, etc. are emerging as fast-growing categories. Additionally, an increased product penetration in existing categories such as fortified water in the health drink sub-segment, fortified noodles, variety of flavours in sports and energy drinks, etc. is likely to drive the demand for nutraceuticals over the next five years.


7)  Future Growth and Opportunities
The Nutraceuticals market worldwide is projected to grow by US$135.4 billion, driven by a compounded growth of 7.2%. Functional Food & Beverages, one of the segments analysed and sized in this study, displays the potential to grow at over 7.5%.  Poised to reach over US$196.4 Billion by the year 2025, Functional Food & Beverages will bring in healthy gains adding significant momentum to global growth. While the Indian market witnessed high growth rates in nutraceuticals, it is still expected to have a long runway to reach. Indian nutraceuticals market constitutes nearly 2% of the global nutraceuticals market. It is expected to grow rapidly and account for 3% - 5%  of the global share by 2022.
Developed countries, including the US, Europe and Japan account for more than 90% of the global nutraceuticals market. India’s nutraceuticals market is expected to double in size to US$ 1.27 billion by 2026, on account of the strong demand for dietary supplements from the upper and middle class.
India, the fastest growing economy in the world, houses over 1.25 billion people and, as per the UN, is forecasted to become the most populated country by 2024. With the growing population, India, a developing country, faces challenges to ensure that there is not only adequate food supply but it also meets the required nutritional levels.
Some Indian companies that are engaged in Nutraceuticals are:

1) Syngene (Contract Manufacturing for Probiotics)
2) Fairchem - Tocopherol Natural Vitamin-E
3) Fermenta Biotech - Vitamin D3
4) Advanced Enzymes - Human & Animal Nutritions
5) Laurus Labs - Synthesis/ Ingredient(Dietary Supplements) Etc

The changing economic and climatic scenarios is globally fostering many hazards to livestock, poultry, aqua & companion animals which needs to be addressed more effectively and efficiently by veterinary professionals and animal health product manufacturers/distributors. This larger picture helps all members with a better understanding of Animal Health and encourages a scientific approach that facilitates the supply of innovative, cost effective and quality products & services.

Animal Healthcare - Industry Dynamics

A ) Beneficial Pricing Environment 

Unlike the pricing landscape of human prescription medicines, where pricing pressure and price control have been the regulators and governments major weapon to control burgeoning healthcare costs, the animal health market has seen little direct government involvement. Unlike the human pharmaceutical industry where eventual buyers are insurance companies or the government in the animal health industry, buyers are pet owners and animal farm owners. This gives the government very little incentive to get involved in fixing prices. 

B ) Increasing R&D Productivity 

Unlike human health, the animal health industry is characterised by higher R&D productivity and shorter development time, as well as lower costs and risks. Animal health products generally show faster R&D timelines in all stages ranging from research to the regulatory review process. Hence, in aggregate total development timelines are typically 3 to 5 years faster than in human drug development. 

C ) Competitive Intensity 

Competition is lower in the animal health industry. There is extremely limited overlap in the product portfolio of Top-10 companies. Market is dominated by the Big US and a few European players. 

D ) Global Scenario

The global population is growing at 0.75% p.a., which is expected to increase from 7.7 billion today to over 9.7 billion by 2050. This increased population cannot be fed by agriculture alone. Livestock farming automatically becomes a secondary yet important source of living. Second, population growth leads to increased demand for land, hence animal farms necessarily have to have enhanced productivity.

Growth drivers for Animal Healthcare Industry 

A ) Trend in Animal Husbandry around the World

Animal husbandry significantly contributes to the GDP of emerging nations around the world. Animals have been domesticated since 13,000 years. Even today, cattle such as cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep that provide milk and meat are the primary source of income in rural areas. Animal husbandry has become technology driven with rising demand on quality of animal products. Like all major industries, it has seen corporatisation resulting in attachment of control on animal infection outbreaks. This in turn has resulted in the growth of the animal healthcare market. 

B) Increase in Pet Adoption and Growing Technology

In the past few decades, there has been a significant expansion in pet adoption, especially amongst the elderly population. The increase in disposable income and increasing acceptability of animals as social companions has led to increase in pet ownership. Amongst some lonely elderly people, certain animal categories like dogs and parrots are seen as an alternative to human children, given their ability to respond to human emotions and signals. The growing number of pets will also boost the overall demand from the animal healthcare industry.

C ) Protein Consumption 

It is estimated that by 2030, to feed the global population, animal protein production will have to increase by 30% from its current volume. Without effective disease prevention and health management strategies, this could impact the meat and dairy industries in a big way. Post consideration of the increased interest in plant-based or lab-based meats and other protein alternatives, animal-based proteins will remain critical in meeting the demand of the world’s growing population. 

D ) Human Population Growth 

The global population is growing at 0.75% p.a., which is expected to increase from 7.7 billion today to over 9.7 billion by 2050. This increased population cannot be fed by agriculture alone hence livestock farming is also simultaneously required. Second, population growth leads to increased natural resource constraints driving a need for enhanced productivity. 

E ) Improved Living Standards 

There is increased focus on food quality and safety as standards of living improve, leading to higher demand for quality non-vegetarian food.

Types of Animal Healthcare

There are many more varieties of healthcare that have developed for animal health but here I would like to highlight the two most important segment of animal healthcare:               

                   

The farm animal healthcare accounts for 62% shares in the entire veterinary healthcare market. Continued efforts are being made by the government with initiatives that help modernise agriculture through technology and continued scale consolidation. With that, stricter food safety/ quality improvements and environmental regulations have formed which are useful as well as easily adopted in many developing countries. 

Governments globally have taken several steps for the development of farm health care animals. These include zero environmental impact of agricultural residues, over the course of the last five years by the Chinese government. Other Governments have enacted notably stringent environmental protection laws.  

The global farm animal healthcare market size was US$ 20.5 billion in CY2019. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% between 2019-2025 with North America being the largest market and Asia Pacific being the fastest growing market. 

Companion Animal Healthcare 

Based on animal type, the market is fragmented into companion animals and livestock animals. Companion animals cover dogs, cats, horses, and others. The companion animals segment is poised to witness around 4% CAGR during the forecast timeframe. The segmental progress is majorly due to the growing number of pets and fast-changing technology implications.

The global companion animal market size in 2019 was worth US$ 12.54 billion and expected to reach US$ 19.18 billion by 2024 with a growth rate at a CAGR of 6.26%. The increase in the number of pets and importance of emphasis on animal healthcare and vaccination has led to an increase in the demand of animal healthcare products. Since pet owners realise that their animal companions are part of their own family, the level of care provided to these animals has significantly improved, thereby driving the growth of this market. 

Rise in the income levels of individuals leveraging recent trends is leading to the increase in the number of pet (companion animal) adoption which ultimately leads to increase in the demand of companion animal healthcare. Additionally, advances in animal health medicines and vaccines, increased types of medical treatment are fostering the market growth of the companion animal healthcare market. 

The companion animal healthcare market is extremely competitive with major players accounting for about 3/4th of the market. Given its highly competitive nature, several companies are focusing more on research and development to produce better pharmaceuticals and vaccine products for the existing and newly diagnosed diseases.

Segregation through Animal Types

Poultry 

Poultry had a short term hit due to the move from the large trend of 50:50 dine in, dine out to 90:10 dine in scenario. This has resulted in near-term supply chain realignment from box packaging to add-supermarket consumption. In a recession, consumers generally trade down a little bit on protein, resulting in slightly lesser meat consumption. However, the same still is expected to grow 1-2% as per past historical trends. It is expected that the same will be normalised in the coming months. 

Pork 

China has a huge demand for pork, which is imported from the USA, Brazil and other geographies. China will need to significantly ramp up protein imports during the next several years from the rest of the world given the ASF disease that decimated Chinese hog production in 2019 and materially reduced protein availability within the country. Pork demand has remained stable thus far. 

Cattle 

It is expected that the cattle population will be maintained for the dairy industry. Beef demand has shifted from restaurants to home dine in due to the former’s closure. As a result, a marginal decline has been noted so far and it is expected that the same trend will gradually become normal in the second half of 2020 with the recent reopening of restaurants in developed countries. 

Further, cattle breeding and rearing is expected to remain constant since livestock owners know that it takes around 2 years to fully breed a cattle.        

Conclusions

In India, Animal Husbandry is making a significant contribution to the national economy and socio-economic development of the country. With 10.71% of world’s livestock population, India stands first in buffalo population, second in cattle and goat population, third in sheep, fifth in chicken and sixth in camel population world over with bovine population of 299.9 million, 135.17 million goats, 65.06 million sheep, 10.29 million pig, 0.4 million camels and 729.2 million poultry as per latest census.

India stands number one in the world for total milk production with an estimated milk production of 140 million tonnes with an average yearly growth of over 4% and per capita milk availability of around 307 grams per day. Poultry industry which provides cheap sources of animal protein has taken a quantum leap in the last few decades evolving from a near backyard practice to a venture of industrial promotion.

Biologics - Untapped Opportunities ,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/08/biologics-untapped-opportunities.html,2020-08-08T16:56:00.016Z,2020-08-08T16:56:00.016Z,Unknown,"India Emerging as a Next Biologic Drug Hub

SHUCHI.P.NAHAR
The Indian pharmaceutical companies always had strong chemistry skills to work on small molecules to make generic drugs, but they lacked skills, people and ecosystem to work on large molecules to come up with reverse engineered versions of biotech drugs, many experts complain. However, it is beginning to change.
 
'India: the emerging hub for biologics and biosimilars', the Indian pharmaceutical companies have launched 123 biosimilars and currently have 201 active biosimilars covering multiple indications in the development pipeline.
Further, India has 95 approved biosimilars in the domestic market, more than any other country in the world.
Biologics are the biological products regulated under the rules of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are used to either diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure various medical conditions. 
Significantly, biologics are large, complex, and diverse molecules produced through biotechnology. And, this uses living systems including animal cells, plant cells or microorganisms. Some biologics are therapeutic proteins such as filgrastim, monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab,vaccines such as for influenza and tetanus, etc.


Moreover, the main challenge of manufacturing biologics is the consequent inherent variations These variations of products have to be characterized with time. Therefore, the FDA assesses the manufacturer's strategy as well as the manufacturing procedure in order to control the product variations.
The biologic market is set to grow, with biologic drug sales forecast to increase from $239bn in 2018 to $493bn by 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11%, according to GlobalData’s Drug Sales and Consensus Forecast (DSCF) Database.
Furthermore, with biologics making up 41% of pipeline drugs, combined with investor understanding of these drugs’ potential and ongoing attractive IPO conditions across all markets, we can expect to see further biologic IPOs in the very near future.
Biologics are one of the top selling drugs worldwide  as well as in the United States but the major
drawback of this drug has been its exorbitant cost,which makes it unaffordable and inaccessible to many patients, especially in developing countries where a large number of people are poor and the concept of health insurance is at its nascent stage.
 
But the silver lining is that once the innovator company loses their intellectual property right and patent protection after a stipulated period, it opens the window of opportunities for companies evince an interest in manufacturing similar products, which cost less, and at that time, it is known as biosimilar or similar biologic.
 
Biosimilar is a biologic product, which is very similar to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biological product known as reference product and has no clinically meaningful differences in term of safety and effectiveness from the reference product.
 
But similar biologics are not exactly identical to reference biologics because of the complex structure, which may be affected by minor alteration in sequences and post translational modification
Degree of Complexity in Biologics
Unlike generic medicines, manufactured through chemical synthesis, biologic medicines contain one or more active principles produced or derived from a biologic source, including a wide range of products like vaccines, allergens or recombinant proteins.

Most biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies, have a highly complex molecular structure that is difficult to identify or characterize and they are manufactured using the most innovative technologies.
 
In biologics, monoclonal antibodies have relevance in the treatment of pathologies that affect a large number of people: cancer, lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis.
 
Biosimilars are medicines manufactured through biotechnology and which have demonstrated their equivalence in quality, efficacy and safety to the reference product.
 
What is the Opportunity for India?
The global biologics market size was valued at USD 276.6 billion in 2015. These products represent cutting-edge research and also enable the latest scientific discoveries. Such discoveries can be translated into novel therapies that provide new treatment options for patients.
 
Moreover, an increased understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of disease has opened
the development of a range of targeted treatments. For instance, recombinant proteins aid the immune system in the identification and binding of foreign substances.

Future in Biologics 
Biologics are basically products that are produced from living organisms or contain components of living organisms. They include a wide variety of products derived from humans, animals or
microorganisms using the tools of biotechnology.
Follow-on biologics and biosimilars as a class of drugs have emerged as an effective alternative
to reduce the cost of biologic therapies.
 
According to a report by Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (Assocham), the global market for biologics will be $240 billion and the Indian market will be over $35 bn by 2030
Indian pharma companies including Biocon, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Zydus Wellness
are actively focusing on the biologics market.
 
Biocon, for instance, earned Rs 1,517 crore or nearly 28% revenue from biologics in FY19- FY20.
A lot will however depend upon factors such as access to cr gitical technology, regulatory guidelines and the price difference between biosimilars and the underlying biologics. For instance, the price gap between the two has significantly widened to over 60% for some drugs in Europe from just over 20% a few years ago. There is a pressing need for the biologic drugs in the global healthcare to address the unmet need in multiple therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, nephrology, immunology, diabetes and others.
 
India is a leading player in the biologics market at global level. Domestic Indian companies such as: Biocon, Dr Reddy’s, Intas Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Pharma, and Lupin Pharmaceuticals are few of the key players with the largest number of products launched in the country as well as in other emerging economies.
Moreover, with growing interest in biologics in the Indian landscape, many new companies,
including startups such as Enzene Biosciences, are also jumping on the biologics bandwagon.

SHUCHI.P.NAHAR

Just like the world around us, animal health has undergone transformational change in the 21st century. Animals are receiving better care, medicines are becoming more targeted, and diseases have even been eradicated. There's no sign that this change will stop soon. Here are the four trends that will drive animal agriculture and petcare in the coming years.The niche global animal health sector is witnessing exciting growth opportunities and consolidation. On the one hand, the opportunity landscape is driven by population expansion, increased demand for animal protein, changing lifestyles and evolving habits. On the other hand, the consolidation is the result of growing compliance and complexity.

The global animal health market size was valued at USD 47.1 billion in 2019 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period. The market is largely driven by a significant rise in demand for protein food and an increase in the incidence of zoonotic and food-borne diseases globally. This unprecedented rise in disease prevalence has triggered companies to produce advanced vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The high demand has also resulted in a subsequent increase in the number of companies undertaking consistent efforts to control pathogen contamination risks and food-borne diseases, which is contributing to the growth of the overall market for animal health.

   
                                                 
The market is driven by technological advancements in veterinary health care,
and this is anticipated to offer future growth opportunities.These advancements include 
the advent of efficient information  management systems, animal owner mobile technology, and vaccine banks.
High focus on innovation in animal health has given rise to certain measures that are strengthening market growth prospects. 
For instance, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private partnership to support collaborative research in order to boost innovation in veterinary pharmaceuticals in Europe.

Animal Type Insights

Production animals dominated the market in 2019. The substantial share captured by the segment is a consequence of high concern for food safety and sustainability by government healthcare organizations globally. Policymakers in various countries are striving to achieve total food security, which propels large-scale food production and results in greater rearing of livestock.
                                                  


Regional Insights
The policies are focused on long-term sustainability, which can be achieved through a combination of improving productivity and greater attention to livestock veterinary healthcare. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in emerging economies, animal-based food products account for one-third of human protein consumption, leading to an increase in livestock productivity, which is critical to meet dietary needs of the growing human population. These factors cumulatively are responsible for the significant share captured by production animals in this segment.

Recently, the $26 billion animal health market has moved beyond straight pharmaceuticals and vaccines, with investors pouring $156 million in pet tech startups alone, according to CB Insights. New venture funds are targeting feed nutrition and data technology as well.  
So what are the most exciting opportunities in a changing industry? Let’s look at three major growth sectors.
 
Livestock Animals
 
The world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion people by 2050 (a staggering jump from today’s 7.6 billion). Meat production is expected to double by 2020 with the population growth, coupled with changes in dietary preference and rising income levels. 
The pressure on farmers to feed more people, with less water and land available, in an environmentally sustainable fashion, will be extraordinary. Livestock production, while increasing, still faces barriers in infectious and parasitic diseases, especially in developing countries while public funding for disease control has been on the decline for decades.
Innovation and biotechnology promise assistance with improved diagnostics and genomics applied to develop next-generation vaccines to prevent disease as well as the development of alternatives to antibiotics tackling disease resistance.

The trend toward antibiotic resistance poses a global threat to humans and animals. Alternative products — vaccines, prebiotics, probiotics and immune modulators, for instance — provide veterinarians and farmers with new options to reduce the use of antibiotics. Their areas of use target herd growth promotion, disease prevention and disease treatment. Major industry players like Tyson and Perdue have already responded to consumer demands for the reduction or elimination of antibiotic use in raising livestock.

Another focus area for livestock production is improving nutrition via feed quantity and quality. Efforts include microbial improvements to soil to make stronger plant nutrients, ways to reduce spoilage, employing microbes to improve animal digestive ability, new mineral and enzyme supplements, and applying gene editing technology to improve nutrient levels in plants.
The flip side of increasing livestock production is an approach to grow the next generation of meat-like proteins or build a market for alternative proteins. Today’s market has witnessed the growth of novel sources of protein, from baking flour made of crickets to the production of meat protein from cell-based cultures. Companies like Memphis Meats and Impossible Foods are earning passionate followings for their innovative approaches to a clean diet that’s friendly to both the palate and a sapped planet.

Family Animals

The livestock sector has no choice but to respond to urgent global demands. The pet segment, however, faces a different challenge: How to cater to pet owners who’ve started seeing their animals as family, and are desperate to help these family members live longer, healthier, more comfortable lives? 
 
In the U.S. alone, 68 percent of households now include a pet, up from 58 percent in 1988. People lavish their pets with love and concern like they do other family members, with the total U.S. pet industry expenditures project to rise almost $6 billion in two years to more than $72 billion in 2018.

Consumer-facing, natural pet products are a booming industry, with middle class owners shelling out the extra dollars to give their animals the same organic lifestyle — from holistic food to natural flea and tick repellents to toys made from non synthetic fibers — they afford themselves. See also the rise of pet insurance, advanced pet surgical procedures, digital devices and specialty pet services to understand how much money pet owners today are willing to spend on man’s best friend.

Animal Healthscape 

Animal healthcare sector has witnessed a paradigm shift to improve the quality of drugs mainly in developed economies. A significant increase in animal production has led to improvement of food safety systems in order to safeguard human health. The rising prevalence of infectious and parasitic diseases is creating the next wave of innovation in managing animal health. 

Modern medicine and technology are focused on improving animal health and livestock production. Increasing demand for poultry and milk products across the globe is, in turn, driving the demand for feed additives, vaccines and drugs. Growing urbanisation, changing lifestyle and increase in per capita income have encouraged pet ownership as well as increased willingness to pay for pet healthcare. These advancements and new technologies have strengthened awareness, making treatment more focused towards effective outcomes, thus fuelling the growth of animal health market.


At a 4.8% CAGR, the global animal healthcare market is poised to reach US$ 45 billion by 2025 because of changing government policies and rising awareness among the general population. The North American animal industry is expected to remain dominant over the forecast period due to high penetration of animal healthcare products with a CAGR of 3.6%. 
This will be driven by an increase in the number of government strategies to promote healthcare policies and is expected to further fuel the growth of the market. Europe, the second largest animal healthcare market, is forecasted to expand at a 4.4% CAGR over the Management Discussion and Analysis period, due to high numbers of pet animals, disposable incomes, animal husbandry practices for meeting ever increasing demand for non-vegetarian food. 
 
Animal healthcare markets in France and Italy account for onethird of the European market and is estimated to expand at 4% CAGR over the forecast period, owing to large population of farm and pet animals. High income of pet owners as well as availability of pet insurance augment pet healthcare practices across the country. Latin America account for 11.5% share in the global market during 2019 and it is expected to remain same till 2025 while growing at a CAGR of 5.5%. Asia Pacific animal healthcare market is expected to witness strong growth at a CAGR of over 6.3% between 2018-2025 due to changing economies along with rising prevalence of animal diseases in this region. 
 
The Indian animal healthcare market is estimated at ` 70 billion in 2019 with livestock accounting for 55% of the total, poultry for 40% and companion animals for the remaining 5%. Animal health in India has undergone significant changes over the last few years because of the adoption of innovative technologies used for prevention and cure of farm and companion animals. The business approach among animal health companies have evolved from therapeutics to preventive and then from productivity.
 
Animal Type Takeaway
 
Animal type segments are categorized as Equine, Dogs, Sheep & Goats, Cats, and Poultry. Among which, dogs accounted for the largest share of the total market, has recorded USD 4.83 billion in 2016.  The demand for dog’s therapeutics is relatively greater than other companion animals and the trend is likely to continue over the future period. Thus, companies are increasingly developing novel therapeutics under this segment. 
For instance, in May 2016, European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Merck’s Bravecto Spot-on solution to treat fleas and ticks in dogs. Later, in July 2016, the company also received U.S. FDA approval for this product under name Bravecto Topical.
 
Product Takeaway
Product segment is divided into Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals, Feed Additives, Diagnostics, and Others. Increasing research and development activities coupled with favorable government initiatives has helped the pharmaceuticals segment to be on the top spot. Drugs segment is categorized into Over the Counter (OTC) and Prescription. Whereas, the distribution channel segment is bifurcated into E-commerce, Retail, and Hospitals. The application segment is divided in terms of Clinics, Point-of-Care Facilities, and others.

Regional Takeaway
Regionally, North America accounted for the largest share, closely followed by Europe. Presence of a large number of established pharmaceutical companies that are consistently striving for extensive commercialization of their veterinary products is presumed to be a key factor responsible for growth in both regions. 
Asia Pacific region is projected to grow with the highest CAGR owing to the rise in adoption of companion animals coupled with the increasing disposable income.

 The Future is Coming
From nearly the origin of our species, history tells us that caring for other living creatures is an innately human act. Innovative ways to protect, treat and tend to the animals means the field of animal health is now evolving to parallel advances in human care. For example, the One Health Initiative urges coequal collaboration between medical disciplines to link human and animal medicines.
Take heed from the advancements all around us. The animal health industry finds itself in a state of major transition and chaos brings opportunity. And we humans continue to find new, innovative ways to live alongside the animals in our lives.

In recent years, pharmaceutical outsourcing has grown in popularity amongst drug developers across the industry. Companies are increasingly outsourcing to contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) due to the benefits outside expertise can bring to their business.
So, what are the benefits and how are current CDMO market trends shaping?

Pharma CDMO's Trends
The pharmaceutical industry is expected to be worth $1.5 trillion by 2021. The key trends driving this level of demand for pharmaceutical products include the world’s aging population, rising healthcare standards in developing countries, and expensive breakthrough therapies. This rapid influx of demand means that companies are faced with higher R&D costs and a need to invest in new capabilities.



The demand for healthcare and innovative solutions is growing globally with chronic diseases on the rise. The global pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow from $1,228.45 billion in 2020 to $1,250.24 billion in 2021 at 1.8% CAGR.

The global pharmaceuticals market is projected to rise at a considerable pace driven by the increasing investments in product R&D. The efforts put in to develop efficient products will bode well for the growth of the overall market in the coming years.


Increase in Investment in R&D


While R&D spending is increasing, innovator companies continue to be challenged by the declining rate of investments in R&D. In the pharmaceutical industry, a considerable proportion of drug candidates fail during the regulatory process. This increases the average cost to develop and secure marketing approval for a new drug. The declining returns are encouraging many drug developers to outsource large parts of their R&D activities, along with leveraging new technologies, to make drug discovery and development cost-efficient and faster.


The CDMO Market


As the industry continues to grow, the CDMO market is increasingly segmenting. The outsourcing sector primarily segments by type of services, such as API development and manufacturing or drug delivery, however segmenting by technologies is also an emerging trend. Thirdly, segmenting by location is a popular approach.

CDMO activity predominantly occurs in Europe and the US. Although the main location, supplying to the European market from outside presents many hurdles, such as the need to retest imported products and the variations in packaging required due to the multiple languages spoken across the market. In contrast, the US market has a common language and regulatory landscape for 300 million citizens, which helps to reduce logistical issues. 

There is scope for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), with over 325,000 M&A transactions occurring in the US since 1985, meaning that there is a large capacity for market penetration and market share. 

Although western markets are often favorable locations, emerging markets also attract the attention of CDMOs. For example, India is a prime location for the CDMO market as it has secured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a large volume of its drug products and is home to a highly-skilled workforce.


A prevailing trend in the CDMO market climate is a preference for outsourcing to CDMOs that provide a full-service offering. This is because these CDMOs operate across multiple locations and markets, offering support throughout the entire drug development and manufacturing process and catering to varying regulatory requirements. Outsourcing to a single CDMO enables drug developers to reduce complexity and in some cases less time to market, as they are dealing with one team.

 “Capacity consolidators”, whereby CDMOs advance their services via acquisitions, are gaining momentum too.

Opportunities to Reduce Costs
There is an opportunity for CDMOs to make a significant contribution to the cost basis of the industry, potentially reducing the overall industry cost of goods sold (COGs) by more than 10% (or about $34 billion) by utilizing best-in-class practices from the pharmaceutical industry and other industries. 
However, the changes and improvements that are required will not be easy or inexpensive. There are also regulatory risks involved that must be managed. Still, there are major benefits if more cost-effective medicines reach the market while continuing to allow the industry to make a fair return on investment.
Opportunities for CDMOs

The global pharmaceutical CDMO market was valued at $160.12 billion in 2020 as compared to $148.5 billion in 2019. It is expected to reach $236.61 billion by 2026, registering 6.5% CAGR during 2020-26. 
·     The CDMO service sector has gained a specifically unique edge to address some of the challenges that drug developers are facing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has impacted multiple aspects of the pharma and biopharma industry, from drug development, clinical trials, supplies, manufacturing to supply chain
logistics.
·    Opportunities for CDMOs Larger companies view CDMOs as vital partners and build strategic integrated long-term partnerships.
·    CDMOs can receive co-investments from firms that finance specialized development and manufacturing facilities at strategic CDMOs. CDMOs using advanced technology and specialized expertise create a niche given the increasing number of complex and high potency compounds.
·    They can capture projects at an early stage and profit from upselling opportunities.
·    CDMOs engaging in continuous manufacturing benefit in the form of increased operational efficiency reduced costs and minimal wastages. Increased number of small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies with no manufacturing capacity responsible for an increasing share of new drug approvals

Tools for Pharmaceutical Companies and CDMOs - Both pharma companies and CDMOs must implement best-in-class practices from all industries to significantly increase productivity and efficiency to reduce industry costs. Some examples of tools being partially utilized in the industry are listed.
Lean Six Sigma - This process improvement methodology has been effective across many industries. Embracing and systematically embedding this process will focus on eliminating waste and reducing variability. It is estimated that 90% of the activities and 50% of the costs in a normal process are not needed. Lean Six Sigma provides all involved with a way to challenge and improve everything. Several effective components are key to the pharmaceutical industry.
Quality by design (QbD) - This aligns development with manufacturing so that the process is designed and developed with long-term outcomes considered. This is key, as many current pharmaceutical manufacturing processes lack this focus and are inefficient for commercial manufacturing, and at this point has become difficult to impossible to change owing to regulatory risk.
The right first time (RFT)  - Doing things with an RFT mentality reduces costly rework and shortens overall cycle time.
Process/cycle time improvement - Process inefficiency and cycle time are major contributors to costs. Process improvements will drive productivity and increase process yields. Cycle time reduction will allow major reductions in inventory, including both unfinished and finished goods.
Technology - Utilization of cost-effective technology will also drive efficiency and productivity improvements, including Parametric control/release, 3D printing, Robotics, Artificial intelligence, Continuous flow processing, and Cellular manufacturing/factory in a box.
Contribution
by small pharma/biotech to new drug development globally


Merger & Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions help CMOs offer integrated bioprocessing services to their clients, which, in turn, makes CMOs/CROs an attractive and feasible option for the rapid product launch. In recent years, the biopharmaceutical industry has witnessed a significant number of consolidations. These consolidations were mainly aimed at business expansion and to stay competitive in the biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing and services market.
Although the biopharmaceutical CMO and CRO industry itself is relatively developed, the inception of new bioprocessing tools, novel therapeutics, and the priority shifts in the bio/pharmaceutical industry about products have increased the pressure on the contract bio manufacturers. As a result, Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) are adopting different business models for addressing their clients’ and stakeholders’ needs in the best possible way.
Furthermore, the integration of single-use systems in production facilities helps the CMO's to economically expand the manufacturing capacity. The single-use products offer fast turnaround and limit allied activities, such as cleaning and changeover validation. However, the contract negotiations between CMOs and customers are observed to be difficult owing to the regulatory landscape and complexity of service. Clients and CMOs are facing issues about the IP rights, warranty, and liabilities, prices, and timelines which increases the complexity of negotiations.
Capacity Utilization - Consumer goods companies run at greater than 85% capacity utilization. The pharmaceutical industry runs at about 30%–35%. An aggressive understanding and focus on increasing capacity utilization will generate major efficiency and productivity improvements that will significantly reduce the product's the cost/unit of product.
The above examples are only a subset of the spectrum of opportunities for improvement across the industry. These are no longer vague concepts but rather well-recognized tools delivering for best-in-class companies whose value has been demonstrated both within pharma and across other industries. The benefits are difficult to comprehend or imagine and challenging to achieve, but at the same time are possible to realize and will be critical to the industry’s future.
CDMOs offer long-term supply security and share the risks due to their robust financial structures. Sponsors also get access to advanced technologies and expertise like High Potent Manufacturing, Isolator technology for injectables, etc. which otherwise requires investment for separate containment areas. This helps the sponsor to focus on their core competencies. 
In addition, CDMOs take care of an end-to-end supply chain that reduces a sponsor’s effort associated with the management of inventory and logistics. This in turn helps to eliminate penalties associated with rescheduling due to delays. CDMOs offering integrated services help reduce time to market by performing all steps under one roof.

Index Investing: Pros and Cons  ,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/07/index-investing-financial-opportunities.html,2020-07-19T07:30:00.002Z,2020-07-19T07:30:00.002Z,Unknown,"Pros and Cons of Index Investing -  By Late Mr. Parag Parikh
Shuchi.P.Nahar
Index funds
are simply mutual funds that attempt to mimic a given market. There are actually many
more than that tracking many different markets of all shapes and sizes, but
each one shares the same basic principle: Its goal is simply to match that
particular market’s return.
Index
investing is therefore simply the process of using index funds to build a
passive investment strategy. Index investors decide which markets they want to
invest in, how much of their money to put in each one, and utilize index funds
to put that plan in place. 
What is market?
Where do you see the market going? how is market judged? By what the index is judged?

These
are some of the basic questions that every investor asks sooner or later in his
investment journey.
 If the index is up that means that the market
is up, sometimes you may find the market is going up but your portfolio has
not increased or decreased.
This was very
evident during the tech boom in 1999-2000 where the technology stocks formed
about 24% of the total index.
If you did not
possess technology stocks and if the index was going up everyone was
rejoicing around you they will think you are not never better off.
in fact every
multinational fast moving consumer good company with strong brands, if you had
them if you had good engineering companies like L & T anything
and you had a convention very good portfolio but during those times you were
always sad because while when the market is growing up but your stocks are
still the same but if you open the papers every day and they would say well the
index is up so much the markets are up so everyone is rejoicing but only a few
people were rejoicing now we have always talked about certain behavioral tendencies in the market.
 One of them is fancies of the market over a
period of time what happens is different stocks , different sectors they become
fancies in the market and when they become fancies in the market people only
follow them because our system is all designed in such a way that you only look
at that sector which is a fancy.
However,
whenever you are talking about a fancy of a sector what is a fancy everyone likes,
it is something everyone chases it. If the stock price starts going up so it
becomes a fancy why does everyone talk about it because the newspapers only
report whereas there has been an abnormal profit or a loss in the company.
 So during times of fancies in a sector like we
had in the technology boom 2006- 2007 we had the infrastructure boom, the
real-estate boom then we had the power boom, now that time all those sectors
were fancy and during that time if you bought any power stocks till date you would
be losing. 
Similarly is
the case with technology stocks also that if you bought in forces in 1999- 2000
anything you are still not very well-off in fact you could be also losing so
sometimes when you are chasing a fancy you end up paying a fancy price and when
that fancy ends what happens is the losses start coming in your pockets.
So markets are
normally made up of a musical chair game and one point of time there is
something which is going up then second time something else comes up and the
real stocks , the real performers which have got steady income, steady
profits they never become fancy in the market they always perform properly.
Now what
are the stock markets anomaly? 
Every company
would have its Growth phase, the maturity phase and eventually it will die, the
markets are made in such a way that what has to be discarded gets discarded and
the new things come because that is rule of the markets. 
Everything is
based upon about continuity, however the companies which are listed in the
markets are about discontinuity because they go through their different
business cycles and that's what happens in a market. 
When you have
an index companies which are in the limelight, companies which are doing well
ultimately come and replace the companies which have become Laggard' so index
was made with an idea to capture what the market is and how could they capture
what the market is only by looking at the size of the markets.
Now what does creative
disruption means - to facilitate continuity by aiding with discontinuity of
the individual corporations so in that consists of a basket of the largest stocks
based on market capitalization. 
Now this index
is based of the large market cap it is supposed to be representative of the
markets however what is in reality happening is when you are about 7,000 stocks
listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange the high market cap stocks which capture
the index the only 30 of them similarly is the case with NSE where the sample
size is only 50 stocks where they are more than about 3,000 stocks listed.
Now we are
going to look at the markets taking into consideration only the market cap if is
it the right way, are we really looking at the markets as it is said to be creative
disruption is in individual stocks ultimately they are thrown out of the
markets creative and new stocks new ideas, new sectors they start coming into
the markets.
 Let’s take an example there was a time
where we had the textile industry, today you're doing exceedingly well in the
70s textile today define any textile representative but this is what creative disruption  is that at that point of time there was no
technology stocks so the markets as times change as things are changing you
have new sectors coming, some sectors moving out and vice e versa  so that's what this called creative disruption
How does
one stock get into the index first case what is the listing history how long it
has been listed in the market? 




Secondly is
trading history today that how long people have been trading in that stock? How
much is the volumes in that stock? 
Fiscal results
also do the same do play their part but there are times like you had with the case
of Reliance power that it was a big market capitalization although it was not a
profit-making company it got into the index in the same NSE the Nifty Index also
we had two companies one was Reliance Petroleum which was not a profit-making
and another was keinz. I think both of them because they were big that is why
they got into the markets that's why for some of these management's it is
important that they come out with big and big issues because we'll see what
happens once the stocks get into the indices so now if you had all these things.
An effective
measure for us to judge the market by asking index key data index project up or
down I think just because there is some falsehood which is flowing and when everyone
is talking about that falsehood then I think it becomes a truth and that's why
each one of us as the same question newspapers also report the same question
but if you really try to understand the basics of in the index then we come
to a realization well going there is no need to ask where the market is going
because if you are running certain stocks your job is to see whether your stocks
are doing well or not, not what the market is going because there may not be
any relation with that.
Value
investing is all about buy something which is reasonable, which is valuable and
those are low P/E Stocks. 
So, if it’s an
active investing in this form then how can a passive investing be really good? 
Now let's look
at some of the behavioral anomalies of the participants of the markets because
for some things which happen in the market is because of a whole lot of anomaly
is not only of the investors but it is also of the companies of the regulators
of the operators of the management let's see them one by one.
1)The
mystery of the Unknown
So most of us
are always willing to pay something higher for something which is unknown for a
mystery and when the mystery get some reveal the charm of the newness goes away
and then the reality comes in this was very evident how did the tech boom start
where it was coming from everyone  that the
computers will lead to change and you will have to do certain things about the
world will come to an end.
What will happen
when everything was on computers and that's how the tech boom started because nobody understood
what it is, so then you have so many companies coming in the technology boom
started and then ultimately with the internet and the dot-com boom in it. 
So everything goes in mystery for people that's why we paid exorbitant prices even
a company small company like AOL they say it took over Time Warner Brothers so
all craziest things started using because the value of the unknown is a mystery.
So unknown that everyone was excited by it so there is one thing certain that
would happen it's like in the markets Buy when everyone is panicky and sell
when everyone is interested.
2)
Management Greed 
The management
of a company would always like the company to come into an index and management
really understands that it is the market cap that gets you in. Then they have
operators in the market, who can really run the stock prices.
I think those
companies whose market cap becomes big and that market caps ultimately helps
them to come so whoever wins out of management also they playing a very big
role in getting the stocks into the index because once your stock is in the index
there are many benefits not only it becomes a fancy for everyone,  not only most of the mutual funds and all they
invest into it but the management gains a lot of credibility the stock is an
index talk secondly, bankers and all they think they also lent against those
stocks so there were lot of other benefits which come in which increases the
management greed also if the market cap increases their own wealth also
increases so it becomes very easier for them to this thing you have this give
stock options and all those things so then they can attract better talent there
are a lot of other issues also.
3)
Operators
How do they go
to derivative operators because operators would love to rig up a stock
especially if it is going to get into the index it becomes easier so you have a
new breed of operators who are looking at rigging that this high market cap stocks?
4) Herd
Mentality
Herd mentality
we've always been talking about it that as more and more people try to get
into index talks when everyone is going, though it starts going with them so
it's like a Pied Piper whatever he starts doing and then people start following.

When everyone starts
chasing and then you have a herd to follow that stock then that person again
becomes a salesman for that stock of course the operators and the herd mentality
they are one thing which go hand in hand together.
Quest: Why do
investors go for index investing?
Index investing
is just a heuristic in the mind it's a mental shortcut the brain takes in
processing information.
 It is more processing all the information that's
where you are taking shortcuts and that shortcuts are known as heuristics.
The herd
mentality it's again everyone is buying so we want to go with it so you have a
big following coming in the mutual funds also if it is in the portfolio of 10
big mutual funds the small ones also would start going behind that.
Then comes no management
fees it is again a big trigger every day saying “I am saving that means my
returns will increase”. Secondly there is no regret aversion, if you have
bought an index stocks, if it goes down you would say the luxury of thinking
that its fine if index has gone down everyone else is also losing, if it went
up everyone else is winning. So here comes the comfort of not losing alone.
Employee
working won’t have to be worried about what the boss will say because he has
bought an index stock. They have all gone down so everyone was doing index
investing and now everyone is at the par level with you there cannot be any relative better performance
of bad performance. 
Secondly, they're advertised very heavily and it creates an
availability bias for them because everyone is having deep pockets will always advertise
their funds talking about no management fees and that is what is liked by
people.
Index
Investing Is Low-Cost
One of the
biggest reasons that index investing is so effective is also one of the
simplest: It’s low-cost. Cost is actually the single best predictor of a mutual
fund’s future performance. Better than past returns. Better than the fund
manager’s track record. Low costs lead to better returns.
Index funds
are often the lowest-cost investments available simply because they don’t
require a portfolio manager who needs to be paid. And they also don’t incur all
the trading costs, taxes, and other expenses that go into some of the more
active strategies. 
Index funds
have a simple job: track the market. That simplicity keeps costs low, and those
low costs are passed on to you in the form of higher returns.

There
have been studies both in favor and against active management. Many managers
perform worse than their comparative benchmarks, but that does not change the
fact that there are exceptional managers who regularly outperform the market.
Index investing has merit if you want to take a broad economic view, but there
are many reasons why it's not always the best route to achieving your personal
investing goals.

CDMO
Industry Insight
The
global pharmaceutical contract manufacturing & contract research market
size was valued at over USD 123.1 billion in 2016. Cost saving and time saving
benefits associated with the implementation of outsourcing is responsible for
driving the industrial growth. 
Companies
are investing in infrastructure, personnel, and technology in order to gain
significant share of the outsourcing revenue. Increasing demand as a
consequence of ongoing patent cliff of the biologic drugs is expected to fuel
demand. 
Presence
of end-to-end service providers that are engaged in providing value added
services for an integrated or risk sharing business model is expected to
bolster progress in this industry. Moreover, new product launches and novel
drug delivery mechanisms are anticipated to drive outsourcing demand.
The industry has been alternating between the
cycles of inadequate and excessive production capacity for contract as well as
captive manufacturers. Hence, it is important for Contract Manufacturing
Organizations (CMOs) to make cautious decisions pertaining to capacity
expansion and choice of deals.
CDMO
Global Market
The
CDMO market is estimated to grow to $157.7 billion in 2025, a compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% since 2018, outpacing the pharmaceutical industry as
a whole.
Even
for the biggest pharma companies, CDMOs have graduated from supply
chain to more ratified value chain partners – no
minor attitudinal adjustment.
Fierce
competition, cost pressure, constant technological innovations and increasing
consolidation activities raise the question of which steps [CDMOs] can take to
secure or expand their position in this contested market.
“Should
they focus on their core business or broaden their range of services? Should
they follow the market trend and consolidate or try to grow organically?”
Which
of these options would most benefit Outsourced Pharma readers?


CDMO is in a growth phase.
Additional manufacturing capacity
Avoiding redundant manufacturing capacity(Capex avoidance before commercial launch)
Opex reduction/avoidance is another driver
Mitigate the risk of supply shortage
Reduce time to market ( If internal capacities are limited)
Favorable macros (increasing population, insurance coverage,ageing societies,rare disease)
Small and virtual biotech need manufacturing infrastructure



Widespread
Growth
Here’s
a look at that estimated 6.9% CAGR growth by service sector.




You
can see consistent growth across the board. Next here’s a look at where it’s
taking place. 


Asia Pacific region is leading
China,India are top  in API/CDMO
US/EU have advanced ecosystem
Asia has lower Capex and Opex relative to US/EU







This
can generally characterize by great fragmentation despite the strong merger and
acquisition activities in recent years. And it’s not only CDMOs acquiring their
competitors.
“Large
life sciences companies and private equity firms were responsible for some of
the largest deals in the sector (e.g., in 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific paid
18.2 times Patheon’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) to acquire the leading CDMO.”
Nonetheless,
the precipice of 2020, the CDMO market remained “highly fragmented, with more
than 75% of participants having revenues below $50 million, and the five
leading CDMOs holding only 15% of the total market share.”
Which
can only mean one thing: More changes are coming to a CDMO near you.
CDMO Business Model




The
segmentation of the pharmaceutical CDMO value chain follows three major
categories:
Drug And Process Development,
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (Api) Production And
Finished Dosage Form (FdF). 


Close
to these CDMO core segments are drug discovery and development support,
provided by contract research organizations (CROs) as well as contract
packaging services, which are provided by CDMOs or specialized contract
packaging organizations (CPOs).
Tasks
outsourced to CDMOs by pharmaceutical companies cover the entire value chain of
a drug’s life cycle, from drug development and preclinical and clinical trials
to commercial production. While traditional CMO services were cantered on their
core competencies in API bulk manufacturing and formulation, CDMOs have also
moved into adjacent segments along the manufacturing value chain. 


Speciality CDMO have a domain technology focus.
Capacity consolidators prefer inorganic growth
Vertical Integratators offer a broad range of services from lab to commercial scale manufacturing


These tasks,
which in the past have been covered by pharmaceutical companies themselves or
by contract research organizations, include medical chemistry, support for
preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, and formulation and process analytics
development.
CDMO
Fragmentation



Source: IIC Presentation
As CDMO
industry is relatively immature and fragmented there lies more growth
opportunity.
Majority
players are very small. There is absence of overall market leadership. CDMO is
a contract related service business which is sticky with long term customer
relations. Many smaller CDMOs are either private entities or part of PE
portfolios. 
Here
are the key pointers that proves the industry as fragmented.

       Highly regulated industry
       High barriers to entry
       High switching cost
       Highly competitive industry
       Majority are privately held 
       Challenging for small companies to
sustain.













Facing
Growth Imperatives
With some
exceptions, today Big Pharma tends to want fewer, more integrated partners, and
so that is a path to survival for many CDMOs.
The branches in the decision-making tree for those CDMOs are:
vertical or horizontal integration, and acquisition or organic growth.




Vertical
Integration
CDMOs
can strengthen core areas and establish themselves by extending their service
portfolio. In general, this kind of expansion “is less costly
and involves lower initial risks than horizontal integration, because the CDMO
can build on existing knowledge. It also fulfils most regulatory requirements
and enables cross-selling to existing customers.”
With
25% of APIs under development highly potent and trending up, offering HP
services is a logical step for many CDMOs, although building HP facilities can
be a costly investment.
The
study also predicts the pharmaceutical-packaging outsourcing market will grow
at 7.3%, due to new and more rigorous packaging and handling requirements. New
technologies – think “smart packaging – allow for improved functionality and
help a CDMO stand out from the competition.


Vertical integration generally seen more straightforward
Customer gets to consolidate sourcing



Horizontal
Integration
CDMOs
that want to diversify their risk or position themselves as fully integrated
service providers can start offering services for other dosage forms, expanding
into a new dosage form tends to be an expensive and risky endeavour. Barriers
to entry include high upfront costs, lack of expertise and reputation, and
finding qualified employees.
Interestingly,
the sterile liquids are the fastest-growing dosage form in the CDMO
market. Profit margins are highest in this segment, making it an attractive
dosage form for new market entrants.
Solid
dosage forms are becoming less attractive (compared to liquid forms), but
“remain a profitable and growing segment,” as this remains the most common
dosage form for newly approved drugs.
Acquisition
or Organic Growth
 “Considerations about whether organic growth
or acquisition is the more suitable method of expansion should be factored in right from the beginning, as they are
closely intertwined with the feasibility of different strategic options [facing
CDMOs].”
Acquisitions
allow CDMOs to expand relatively quickly. They add new technologies to
portfolios and access to new customers, again opening opportunities for cross
selling. Some CDMOs are also looking to gain a more global footprint through a
merger.
The
caveat: Only ~50% of mergers across all industries succeed, “and the choice of acquisition or organic growth is strongly linked to
the financial means of the CDMO.”
CDMO Opportunities and Risk
Opportunities


Increasing pharmaceutical specialty chemicals research, developments and manufacturing outsourcing (Capex, opex avoidance , risk mitigation)
Increasing number of virtual,small biotech and small to mid pharma with inadequate development,scale up infrastructure
Technological advancement
New operational techniques
Help big pharma transform fixed costs to variable
Faster research at lower cost

  Risk

Zero tolerance culture for clients IP protection
Breach of data protection (Regulatory Compliance)
Ever evolving and fragmented regulatory environment
Competitive marketplace unless CDMO has some unique advantage
High dependence on skilled labour 
Supply chain disruptions
Customer concentration 
Innovator pausing or suspending development 
Termination of relationship




Conclusion
CDMOs
that want to succeed need to consider their reaction to current trend and
evaluate their strategic options.Capabilities company size, ownership, risk preference,
organizational culture and available capital are just some of the factors that
must be taken into account. 
CDMOs face excellent growth opportunities in a
pharmaceutical market environment where using outsourcing service is becoming
new norm.
Critical Success Factors


Respect for innovator's intellectual property 
Immaculate regulatory compliance track record
Superior technology investments
Agility and supply chain reliability
R&D,documentation,data integrity and manufacturing excellence
Client Centric mindset
Adequate human capital investments(Skill & Capacity)
Adequate research,development and manufacturing infrastructure

Shuchi. P. Nahar


Life is all about learning. Sometimes we fail and sometimes we succeed but when it comes to investing why people take it otherwise. Staying in the industry for just 2-3 years I have learnt a lot and here I would like to share my learning with you all. 
Don't consider investing or markets otherwise, it is part of your life and its not your whole life. Success and failures are irresistible. Learning from them is the biggest key for a happy and wonderful life. Hope this article will be a value addition. 


 11 Important Lessons that I Learnt from my 2-3 years of Experience in this Roller-coaster Ride, 
That's Just Begun....
  
1) Be Observant


So when I began my investing journey , markets & investing were all new to me, having the best opportunity and best mentor around me , I couldn't let any of those moments be wasted. 
Having a desire to learn every second is the only thing that will always keep us on our toes and will never let us take things for granted. This key helped me to gain maximum and learning every second was the biggest takeaway.


Being extra attentive then others will not bring any problem, rather it will help you imbibe all the qualities that you see around. 
Mentors will guide us, they will show us the right path and way to reach , but in the end it's upon us how we ride the journey. 


2) Great Losses are Great Lessons 


When I entered the markets in early January 2018 markets somewhere just started to fall and looking around me I observed that someone were confused about buying options or someone was struggling about their current portfolios. 


I realized one thing: Never marry your stocks. It was the falling market which made me think (Gladdd!!!! I wasn't invested) 


Looking at all of it I understood one thing , that take risk as per your appetite not looking at what others do. It's not important to always to learn from our own mistakes, sometimes taking advantage of others' mistakes will save our money and time.


One incident that i can relate with : one of my colleague got heavily invested in one of his diligently researched stock. He concentrated his entire portfolio in that one stock and when markets started crashing down, he went upset. 


Looking at him I realized one thing that never put all your eggs in one basket and secondly if things don't go according to your research in one year of your purchase start moving out. 


3) Documenting Every Stuff


This was one the best lessons I learnt by attending one of the courses of Neeraj Sir. He urged everyone to write and prepare journals and by listening to him I felt there is nothing wrong to have proof of everything. It's one of the best habits that I cultivated.


It's not just a proof but it's a journey that will keep on improvising throughout your life. Sometimes you may forget your mistakes but your journal won't let you repeat it again. I started documenting from that same day Neeraj Sir said and today after two years of that I have each and every small/ big mistakes or an achievement written. Everything has been recorded. I call that journal or diary a Hall of mistakes.


4) Appreciate Yourself


Never compare yourself with what others do, or what they have achieved. I learnt this when I started my journey, that everyone around us is going to be better in something or the other, where we cannot reach. So it's better to concentrate on what abilities we are born with rather than wasting time and cribbing over other's success. 


I learnt this in markets, whatever is written in your destiny sooner or later it will happen. Doesn't matter if my researched stock is bought by someone at a lower rate and I couldn't step into it.. It's fine! It's absolutely fine if you cannot, wait may be some bigger opportunity waiting. Just never let your morale and enthusiasm come down. They are the key for us to stay motivated. 


5) Be Frugal


Don't spend money for something unnecessary, or else one day you have to sell your  necessary stuff for money. It's not about not enjoying or not doing something that we love, it's about knowing when to spend and how much to spend. 


When I started living far from my hometown for my job I realized life is not that easy what I imagined. Staying alone teaches a lot. We all will agree but I learnt the greatest lesson and that was to spend every penny so carefully that you don't regret ever. Now when it comes to investing just don't spend your hard earned cash on something you are not sure about, there will be a lot of noises around we have to filter the best one. 


6) Stay Away from Biases


Biases will never let you grow in the real world as well as in investing. Sometimes we all become the victims of one of the biases. Be that a recency bias, researched stock bias, conservatism bias or closed mind bias. Something or the other once in a lifetime everyone of us would have faced. 


Avoiding such biases will help us avoid many mistakes and surely will help us to make confident decisions. When we fall into the trap of any such bias we don't know where we go wrong and the second wrong thing we do is blame others. Blame game won't stop ever, and success begins when we ourselves take charge of our mistakes. 


Do your own homework, and write your own exam. In the end you and your luck should be the reason for every decision. 


Just to add an real life my experience: I had one company that I studied for approximately 3-4 months and made a report and did all the due diligence required and after few days someone very close to me gave a negative perspective about it, for which I wasn't prepared. I got bamboozled now what ? Itni mehnat ki and ab all in vain but then too new to markets have that research bias wala keeda - kar diya invest.. 
So here came my researched stock bias and unfortunately I made my dad invest in it. So just one crip takeaway keep both the perspective in mind and people who are pessimistic will always help you find the flaws nicely. 


7) Be Fearless


Why to fear losses or failures? We all are learners here !


I learnt this from my mentor Chetan sir. Initially when I began my journey I feared what if I don't do things properly, what if Iose money, what if people will judge me that my thesis went wrong. 


He just said one thing: we all are learners, no one is perfect and no one is supposed to be perfect. We all evolve, we should learn from our mistakes and just keep moving. 


We should not be afraid of trying new things, or we should not be afraid of things that don't go in the same manner we planned. We are riding a rollercoaster, just enjoy it!
Breathtaking moments will surely come but in the end you'll definitely smile. 


Higher the risk, higher the returns. We should not worry about returns just give a best shot while taking risk, and return will take care of itself. 


8) Stay Dedicated


Dedication is the most important thing that can change anyone's life. If you are dedicated to something , nothing can stop you to excel in it. I started at the age of 18 and heard many people around me saying that she is just a kid. Thinking about what I would be knowing at that age and stepping my foot in one of the complex sectors(Pharma)as all says. 


After two years I realized one thing if you are dedicated to something there is nothing that can stop you. If you are dedicated you don't need any motivation to get up everyday for office or you won't need any vacation either. Doing what you love will always keep you dedicated. Never let anyones opinion change your decision. It's you in the end, who matters the most. 


9) Keep Learning 


Our minds are like parachutes, it should be open everytime or we will die due to narrow mindness. 
We all are students, no one is an expert. Some will have more experience and some with less experience. But there is always room for improvement. Never ever consider yourself superior to others, that will be the stage when you will be deteriorating. 


No matter how well known or rich you are, it's just a phase of your life. Never take that too seriously! Once it's gone it will be gone forever. What will stay with us forever is our learnings and our politeness. Be humble, be kind and keep learning. 
There are a lot of amazing things that we can never reach in this lifetime, so never stop learning. 


10) Stay Jolly 


Above all this is THE MOST IMPORTANT lesson that I learnt. Stay jolly -Staying happy is the only way we can achieve whatever we want in life. If we are not happy by what we don't we cannot go the long way. Work is a part of life, it's not life. Spending time with family, friends and most importantly with yourself is the best way to stay happy and enjoy every moment of life. 


Thanks to this covid-19 which helped binding families together, knowing what was more important. People who owned Mercedes were also at home and people owning a rickshaw were also at home. 


Doesn't matter how much you earn or how much the world recognizes you, in the end you should be able to bring smiles to your near and dear ones that's the real wealth. 
Smiles don't come only through spending money, it comes by spending our valuable time with our dear ones. 


11) Staying Positive


There will be lots of moments when things will not pan out the way we imagined. Some days will be there when all the hard work goes in vain. That's not the time to mourn or be negative about yourself , it's time to learn from those failures and prepare yourself for the next move. 


Thought process evolution after this 2020 market fall…


This market crash taught me to be more confident in myself. Where everything was falling and people were panicky “ab kya le” “sab toh ghir raha hei” “aur kitna niche jaayega”. 
I learnt one thing never deviate yourself due to the market noises, time kharab tha , company thodi kharab hai. Just stick to your thesis , go and read history. 


Sit back and relax and continue with your reading and learnings. Don't go in herds just because someone close to you is going. It's fine if we don't follow the crowd . 
What we need to do at that time is just to make your thesis strong, grab opportunities by having strong conviction from inside, not the distraction from outside. 


Doesn't matter how many times we fail, go wrong , or get criticized, if we are confident in ourselves , things will definitely go our way. 


Everything happens for something good. If you cry over things that you don't have , you will never appreciate what you have been working so hard. If you are here , reading this today - you are alive ,you can do wonders  if you want to , you are blessed. 


Appreciate that blessing. So lastly I would thank everyone who was directly or indirectly part of this learning journey. 


Stay happy ! Stay positive ! Keep reading..

Q&A with Radhika Gupta & Mohnish Pabrai,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/06/q-with-radhika-gupta-mohnish-pabrai.html,2020-06-28T05:11:00.004Z,2020-06-28T05:11:00.004Z,Unknown,"Post Pandemic Views & Investment Journey - Mohnish Pabrai
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar
Shuchi.P.Nahar
Introduction:
Radhika Gupta, CEO of Edelweiss Asset Management, and Mohnish Pabrai discuss bridge, Dhandho investing, Mohnish’s lunch with Warren Buffett, the importance of patience in investing, and the current investment landscape.
Quest by Radhika Gupta: In order to start this conversation with a quote that she has heard from mohnish pabrai and this is something very close to her, you said that the good news in investing is there are no HR problems because if there are no humans there are no problems. So if we want to know why Mohnish Pabrai chose to invest as a career because he actually started out in sales and marketing and then he did entrepreneurship and then turned investor so how his professional journey took a turn?
Answer by Mohnish Pabrai: So most of us when we grow up we basically tend to confirm what the world expects of us or how the world expects us to act or behave or things to do and so on so forth. 
So each of us as humans has a some has a kind of let's say core map of who we are on the inside and then there is how we act on the outside and the problem with the map that we have,on the inside of who we are the theory is that it's hard-coded at the age of five between your genetics and first five years of life experience and after that it's not going to change for the rest of your life.
So it's pretty much set in stone the problem is that most of us do not know ourselves well enough to know what that inner map is,so we go through life and that would be called as misaligned.
So for example, if you have this as your inner map and this is your outer map this is typical in almost most humans there's the misalignment and if you can get to inner and outer aligning really well which happens in a lesser of humans you can go really far in life because then you're maximizing all.
You know capabilities and you know preferences and what you love to do and so on. 
In 1999 so when he was 34 years old and that's when he actually got a document which gave him his inner map and a lot of things that he had been doing until then were not in sync.
So you cannot change your inner map it is what it is and and the best that you can do is make the way you go through life be as closely aligned as possible to that in a map.So one of the first thing  that two psychologists had told him because he was just about to start Pabrai Funds it was about three months before pabrai funds  - started and while then he was running an IT company with 160 people and they said to him that they actually don't even understand how he was able to function in this environment with all these people because so far away from where he was  and they said that they know it's not possible for a guy like him to involve with so many people altogether. 
Mohnish Pabrai described to tell  them what Pabrai funds were going to look like and they said that looks perfectly aligned with what his inner map is and in fact one of them became one of the original investors in Pabrai funds.
Quest:  Let's know about Entrepreneurs,you've had this belief that entrepreneurs take risk and people think they take risk and they get rewarded because they take risk but in reality and entrepreneur wants to do everything to minimize risks they want free lunches,if they can get them and go after them but is this the whole Dhandho investing framework that you talked about in the book and actually what is the story behind the framework in the name ?
Answer:  The common misconception is that entrepreneurs take too risk and so if we ignore venture-backed startups which are a completely different animal they represent less than 1/10 of 1% of all startups so we can we can ignore venture-backed startups they don't represent the reality of how 99.9 percent or more of businesses get started.
 So for an example of let's say a dry cleaner for example so there are two towns they're like 20- 30 miles apart and they have dry cleaners in both those towns and then there's a new Township coming up between those two towns let's call it town C and town C is coming up and this one cleaner notices that some people are driving quite a bit of distance to come to him because there's no dry cleaner than so he starts questioning the people there , that basically there's an opportunity because there's not writing is there so he might he might open a small shop there it might not even have any facilities just might be a place to take in and deliver clothes but still keep the back end at his main place he could minimize a risk of doing that by you know keeping the lease short and keeping the space small and so on so forth and then once it gets going he can scale that up and if it doesn't work he can pull that back and just go back to the way he was operating. 
So basically the idea is that being an entrepreneur it doesn't matter you know you're running a restaurant or a gas station or whatever basically the the idea is that entrepreneurs look for arbitrage opportunities and as we understand arbitrage in markets pure arbitrage is risk and entrepreneurship is not risk-free but it's pretty low risk in the manner in which most entrepreneurs approach it so they try to do all kinds of things to make sure that the the downside is limited.
Now coming to the word Dhandho so Mohnish Pabrai had one of his  roommate in college was a Gujarati guy in college in South California and  he had a bunch of relatives uncles who had different businesses motels laundromats you know 7/11 so on and so several times on the weekend he would disappear to meet different family members and  come back Sunday night he'd be like have all these stories of all these deals his relatives his uncle had to bought a new motel or whatever and then the end when he finished telling me all those stories. Later he would say Mohnish dhandho etle s The Dhandho Gujarati word that the direct translation is business but we know that what it really means is an approach to doing business which gives you upside the downside.
Quest: Entrepreneurs money when you practice and approach that's upside with more downside and you say heads I win tails I lose I think it's very relevant for a market like India which is so chaotic.


I mean it's economically chaotic it's also politically chaotic now how do you actually practice that kind of investing so do you have a checklist in mind and if you had to give people a bit because that's what everyone's trying to achieve in a market like India how do you practice that ? Is there a checklist that you have? What are the few things that you tell people who want to practice that kind of investing?

Answer: The checklist comes in a little later in the process as in the sense that you're trying to make sure you've thought about all the things you should think about before making investment.

When you first encounter a business as a potential investment ,the first question you should be asking yourself is how would I lose money on this investment ? Not how I would make money but what are the ways in which things can go wrong and after that you can satisfy yourself that you can't easily come up with a scenario where things can go wrong.
Focus on the downside,upside can take care of itself.
So what we really want to do in investing is we want to look for investments where the downside is very muted.
Quest: One question I had is and this is the obvious question about crisis obviously you've seen 2008 you're seeing the current crisis around over you know whatever mistakes you've made in 2008 that you learned from and you feel that you held up better because of those during this period? 

Answer: We're still going through the period. 
For the time will tell but the number one area which had trouble in the portfolio has been making investments in leveraged businesses and buying leveraged financial institutions.
As Mohnish Pabrai runs a concentrated portfolio typically of ten investments, I think if the lesson I took from there is to stay as far away as I can from leveraged institutions and from in general staying away from all types of leverage business. 

He doesn’t have any leverage in his portfolios and personally has no margin or anything like that. We don't go there but just want to make sure that even the businesses we get into typically are not in that space and you know when he talked about the checklist earlier.

The number one reason that value investors don't do well on their investments is the leverage they were like four or five large reasons why investments don't work out leverage was the number one you know some aspect of management of ownership and their ethos was another one and then you know some aspect of the moat, misunderstanding the competitive advantage was another one so these are three big ones but leverage is the biggest one.

Quest: Is this post-pandemic and this crisis is different from the 2008 crisis?
How do you see it is different? I mean do you think is there a post covid investing world or is that too big of a phrase describing too much to this current crisis? 

Answer: As of now, as we all know India loses about a hundred - thousand businesses a year that just happens normally in a normal economy in the US and we create more than 1,00,000 businesses then that whole creative destruction is what makes the economy destroyed way more than hundreds of businesses we've destroyed.


In his opinion probably hundreds of thousands of businesses and many of those will never come back because they are very fragile and to begin with you know you take some restaurant or some barbershop and such I mean these are difficult businesses they're surviving in a steady state in a very competitive environment it's hard to know it takes the pull the rug out from under them and have them come back.


India's unemployment rate remained steady at 23.5% in May 2020, according to a survey conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). This was not a significant deviation from unemployment numbers in the previous month.



So I think that the recovery even though governments have taken very good action in terms of you know supporting it and supporting the financial system and all that in the u.s. we were at you know three odd percent unemployment we had the best job market in January in the history of the United States. 


It was just the most amazing economy more than 160 million people employed we will probably not see that again in my opinion at least for at least five years and it may be beyond that might even be ten years so it's hard to know how long it will take the United States to get back to three % or for India to get those 100-125 million people back to work but it's not going to be this year it's not gonna be next year it's not gonna be it will not be whenever you're vaccinated we have created serious permanent damage to the global economy.


Quest:  A related question from an Indian investor. What you know is one of the things that the Indian investor has been looking at and many people listening on the corners, they've been looking at the US market and you know you talked about the economic damage? 
So how do you see the US market and the way it's moved and it's hard to talk about this given what has happened to the economy and the economic impact and for someone sitting in India who's looking to invest in the U.S also which is a lot of people today? 


Answer: So the US markets for the most part have brushed off covid as an ordered event. I mean if you look at the decline in the stock indices on March 23rd was low but the economy's come I mean the stock markets come rolling back a lot of good news is priced in and to some extent, some of that may be justified because markets are forward-looking.


I think the United States is you know superhuman economy it's a superstar economy it's the best most amazing economy on the planet with all the factors you know set up to unleash all the entrepreneurial energies of the country and such so it's an amazing creation will bounce back and the American spirit they will try to bounce back as quickly as possible. I think even two years from now we'll still be maybe at 7-8 %  unemployment.


Quest: Markets have accurately discounted the macro covid events sitting in the US how they look at India I think India obviously is an economy that was probably in tough shape going into orbit we've been in the midst of a credit crisis since 2018 are there bright spots that you see in India and how do you see India kind of coming out of this?


Answer: India does a lot of self-inflicted wounds on itself so, for example, we know that there is an excellent exodus from manufacturing in China that started happening after the US government started imposing tariffs and there were lots and lots of companies that were looking at alternative places to China so they could continue to manufacture at competitive rates.
 
Vietnam for example picked up massive amounts of manufacturing from China and India, for example, picked up very little and the reason India picked up a little is we make it really really hard to attract the foreign investment we have so many rules that are backward and laws that are backward and they defy Ricardo they defy Adam Smith meaning the mantra for how to make a country rich is extremely well known you can study Lee Kuan Yew and you'll get there you can study Augustine Pinochet you can study the Chicago economics school you can study Adam Smith you can study Ricardo none of these models is what India photos and it blows my mind.


 That it's not like we have a lack of brains or at the center we have a lack of understanding of what makes an economy tick and how to make an economy like India work really well and grow really go at very high rates and some of that gets to work bank politics where once you start focusing on those types of factors then you can forget about great economic results or great growth rates.

SHUCHI.P.NAHAR
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar

 Background
Sajal Kapoor is into the operational risk and regulatory compliance industry and within that industry, he has been working across domains from banking to healthcare to investment forms. 


Over the last 20- 25 years and that has been highly rewarding and productive because,

That gave him the opportunity to look at the world from a risk and compliance point of view.

Experience that he got from the industry, experience working through banks and healthcare firms, consultancies, and investment firms gave him a sort of a different perspective, and somewhere in the background starting around the mid-90s this hunger and drive to know more about this animal called Mr. market and that started emerging.

 It has been a very long and rewarding journey it has had its own sort of ups and downs like any investor goes through and but those ups and downs are like the tuition fee that you pay and you get to get yourself up and running and so after some initial hiccups and there was an IPO boom going on in mid-nineties some money was lost of experience and he is always hunting for that unknown, unseen undiscovered and potentially undervalued business somewhere and that's being his journey.



Sajal Kapoor has also tried and restricted himself to the pockets where he has got some sort of inherent advantage. So he restricts himself to 3-4 sectors only and that kills the 80% of the universe. He will not even consider looking at that and by so its his professional and investing passion combined together that gave him a lot of unseen perspectives.


Investing Framework-  Seven Core Pillars


All seven pillars are important. Emphasizing one over the other will not justify the essence of the investing framework.
One important lesson for all we need is to keep learning, keep evolving and this is not done instantly, any imagination or sort of a rigid framework will keep evolving and as you go along. 
Investing as we know is all about continuous learning so the moment you stop learning you'll start crashing.

Circle of Competence

Management

Industry structure

Business economics 

Psychology 

Narrative and Numbers

Cycle and valuations



Circle of Competence

Over a period of time after losing money in certain sectors and gaining disproportionately and some of the other sectors coupled with his sort of professional career and background he understood that it's very important to stick to your circle of competence.


As Warren Buffet says it doesn't matter how big your circle of competence is as long as you know the boundaries and that's fine and the whole benefit of staying inside the circle of competence is that you don't have to be better than and everyone everywhere right and so you just aim to win in the league in which you play.


 And the league in which Sajal Kapoor plays is all about sustainable long-term compounding businesses the pharmaceuticals be chemicals he has played some autos as well these are the four key pockets.


 He has  played over the years and as I call them that circle of components is tend amount 
to circle of luck so the more you shrink your circle and the greater your luck quotient goes up the other thing is that it's easy to learn from your mistakes.


So if you are playing within a restricted sort of COC and mistakes will tend to happen mistakes as Sajal Kapoor says he has made mistakes in pharmaceuticals, made mistakes in FMCG and he has made mistakes even in my very small tiny circle.


But you will find it easier to learn from those mistakes because you know the boundaries of yours and of your circle of competence and there was a tweet that he did last year from Joel and that said that “choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you are looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. you may live but you are still an idiot” because you don't know what you don't know and that's the reason and defining a circle of competence is important.


Basic General guidance to new entrants
Quest: If someone wants to invest in equity, how do one realize or identify stocks around the
circle of competence says for example If someone is into the business of chemicals so how do someone identify the circle of competence with less background in investing?
Ans: So if you are in the chemical industry you have an inherent advantage you understand the supply chain dynamics you can talk to your suppliers you talk to your business partners so you know the end-to-end chain and the trade channel and so on.
That is giving you some edge but investing is slightly different so you have the domain knowledge but then what is suggested is such a person should start attending AGM and start attending con calls.


Start reading the controls of not only the companies that you want to invest into but as many as possible within that sector and try and connect your thoughts in terms of where the puck will likely be not where it is today you don't make money from historic earnings market rewards the future potential or the Delta relative to the valuation.


So you need to understand where the puck will likely be and for that, you need to, unfortunately, do some hard work and go through the Con calls go through the annual reports,  AGM and if you're not confident there is no shame in investing through mutual funds, to begin with, and have your own logbook of your learning and then take notes through these channels.


The importance of reading as many con calls as you can and the reading over the years annual report is of great importance but this whole journey may take some time right it's not going to happen tomorrow and in the meanwhile not to miss out the compounding opportunity you can start investing through a good mutual fund. 

Management

The second important pillar in my framework is management and and and you cannot get this pillar wrong because anything multiplied by zero as raamdeo agrawal says quite often is zero and many people have said so so the management is the allocator of the capital is and it's the agent and the managing our business and you can't get that wrong.


 So having skin in the game: is important so management should have some material ownership of the business and typically Sajal Kapoor says he go for nothing less than 30% in the Indian context but he may prefer less globally, so if it's a well-diversified large business like a Lanza or the GSK or a Unilever he doesn't care because they're professionally managed managers.
 He won't care about the promoter stay because the promoter is usually a sleeping entity in those businesses but talking more from an Indian context he thinks 30%  is the sort of the threshold minimum threshold that he has used and usually comfortable. 


Walking the talk by this he means management could talk the talk in an endless manner but if they are not actually implementing and not following it up with some concrete action or ground then that that doesn't make sense.


How to validate? Sajal Kapoor suggests going through the con calls or past annual reports and where they show an example further down and you need to go back five-ten years look up the annual reports and if the con calls, just randomly pick up and try and connect the dots that you know what the management was telling say in 2010 or 2015 and how much of that has actually transformed into implementation and action in terms of taking the business forward.


So that's another critical point and also how do they react to stock movements if the stock price is correcting how do they react if the stock price is rising how do they behave and some see that on the annual report they say their market capitalization has gone up by some percent or in the next five years they want to be at a certain market cap as the management.


So be wary of them, management cannot control that.  It's not within their sort of powers they cannot control the external environment they don't control the cycle,  they can just control their balance sheet.


So if management is quoting some sort of growth it's an important sort of red indicator if the management is talking about a more interested in a stock price and also listen to their interviews and see how they interact with the stakeholders how they answer queries on the con calls and what's been there a capital allocation track record you get it from the ROCE and that type of thing any known integrity issues of fraud just do google talk to people and you will get some sense there and lastly what about their strategy,  is the strategy been consistent or not? 


Let's take the example of Biocon, Kiran Majumdar she is active on all social platforms and people find it inappropriate but her goal is to develop blockbuster molecule, ones that could benefit the masses so it's all about affordable innovation and look at the scale of that the business has done right from 50 crores to 318 million in revenues to it's 55 billion rupees and plus in 20 years so a huge scale-up has happened and the chatter and the noise were very negative all throughout but that's where you need to sort of differentiate between the noise versus the voice.

Industry structure

The next sort of pillar the third pillar which is the industry structure and the devil is always in
in the detail so if you read a good book from Pat Dorsey there is also a little book that builds wealth and I remember there was a quote along the lines that moats are always absolute and not relative.


On this company in an instruction effective industry could well be better having a wider mode relative to the best company in a brutally competitive industry like a commodity so that quote from a little book that builds wealth it's a great book I would encourage but superficially when you look at the industry structure you may think that it's all about Porter's five forces.


our suppliers,  the threat of substitutes, and so on but it's much deeper and wider than that because there are geopolitical pressures, there are regulatory aspects especially in the industries where Sajal Kapoor invest, like in the chemicals and pharma.


Pharma sector directly is an umbrella industry in itself because you can look at the generics and that will be completely different from API's and then you've got biologics,  biosimilars,  innovators these small big innovators,  virtual biotechs and each of these is a sort of a mini-industry in its own.


Because the five forces and the industry dynamics are very different and so there is no such thing as the pharmaceutical industry,  that's the myth there are ten different sorts of industries within that umbrella and you got to have a very clear understanding of the dynamics play out because the dynamics are very different across generics and the innovator even the custom synthesis the content development and CDM or crams as we sometimes each of these sorts of components are very different in terms of the industry structure and when the industry structure turns from negative to positive you make money.


Chemical industry structure was in 2012 because China started withdrawing and the whole structure and something similar happened with the cement industry 20- 25 years ago cement industry today is very stable it wasn't like that in the mid-90s. If you want to trade a stock you have to analyze this stock you know the technicals the head and shoulders and whatnot the cup and fill them all your cycle but if you want to invest you have to analyze the industry structure and the underlying business and then so that's a very fundamental third pillar in my framework.

Business Economics

The fourth pillar that is all about these sort of business economics and all as Charlie Munger says that almost all good businesses engage in pain today and gain tomorrow so you need to invest in capabilities and capacities upfront and the cash will come at a later point in time and this cycle is different for every business.


So the example of a pharmaceutical business if you are setting up a cream-filled facility it's a four to five year gestation period assuming that you are targeting the regulated market the unregulated markets maybe two to three years but no less than that so the capital allocation will not be known tomorrow so if you're putting up a greenfield facility and you want to make complex API's or injectables or the highly regulated markets of Japan and yes it's a five-year game approximately and at the end of that when the cash starts and coming out you would figure out whether the management was right in calling that out.


Understanding the economics of the industry they saw what was happening in the world and implementing it up front in their own companies. Example to go for the backward integration and this is all the size of the opportunity and the other important dynamics in this business economist is the entry barriers because of the opportunity is huge but there are no entry barriers as so for solar industry for the economics of the business will get killed no one would make money you need to worry about the entry barriers and of course, the capital efficiency which is and of course how clean is the balance sheet, because the quality of the business is easy to quantify you look at the balance sheet in a down-cycle at the bottom of this we look at the cash flows.

Psychology

The psychology of the market as well as your own psychology, what kind of investor you are, what are your goals, what are your aims, what are your objectives and you need to align the two so the first thing is to try and understand yourself.


Then decodes that investing lies at the intersection of economics and psychology and the place where the net present value means freedom and greed and fear and everyone is doing this DCF analysis and all the rest of it but these are all about under evaluation overvaluation and the psychology of the market participants from immense fear to extreme euphoria they will keep repeating and if you understand the psychology. 


If you understand the business if you understand the domain in which you are playing inside a circle of competence you can have a reasonable estimate not an accurate estimate reasonable, an estimate of the likely value of that and if the market is giving you a good opportunity to buy and you move because if you see that this is a significant discount because of the market and excelling or whatever and if there is an extreme euphoria.

Narrative and Numbers


The narrative must be seen in numbers ( over the period )

CFO has to compound overtime

Market value= NPV of future cash streams

Narrative and Numbers and this is something that has evolved in recent years and that the narrative has to match the numbers The numbers have to match the narrative one without the other is not game. Mostly in pharmaceutical business ratios like CFO/EBITDA, not less than 0.6 or we can track enterprise value or operating cash flows, ROE or ROCE, WACC, CFO or FCF, EV TO CASH SALES.


Don't invest or liquidate.
Look at the enterprise value you look at the operating profits you look at the cash flows and you look at for a better ratio so typically in anything less than 0.6 for CFO to EBITDA  is a red flag.
 Some companies so jubilant Life Sciences for example did this propose at 250 or something recently but if you look at the CFO to a better ratio for jubilant Life Sciences is one of the best in the industry it's 0.8 you almost have to match the narrative and try to just extent.

The other example is the Tyche Industry. They haven't done anything else far as the cash flow is concerned the stock may be busing along. It was buzzing around yesterday as well and it's an industry company. But the highlight that looks if you look at their operating cash it has done nothing from point to point it has done nothing it has it's up and down but it should be a gradient of 30-40 degrees right something like this.
 
One Another is positive Solara pharma again early listing only two-three years of cash but they started scaling up quite well and that's what is likely to see in the businesses that over time the cash should be growing because see if you are getting good operating cash flow and if the management is prudent they can find some growth Capex and opportunities to utilize that cash it could be an M&A it could be an organic initiative. so focus has to be on the balance sheet focus has to be on the operating cash flows.

Cycle and Valuations

Refrain from valuing business on P/E or P/B  when the past few years have been miserable or wonderful.
Instead one should focus on EV/Free Cash Flow or EV/OCF.
The final pillar is all about this cycle and evaluations and so there are multiple cycles that come into play. There's always that GDP or the economic cycle is a concrete cycle and the most important cycle is the business cycle because The business cycle is about to turn, where the market cycle is or the economic cycle is so the economy may suffer but pharmaceutical chemical companies may do relatively better even as opposed to some of the more and heavy industrial sectors that are heavier and they need the real economy. 


You know the CAPEX play for example and so the business cycle you need to understand the business cycle that where is it in the business cycle if the capacity has been extended or expanded for some niche launches and the business is about to turn into a positive cycle and regardless of where the market of the economic cycle is the gains will flow if the market cycle is conducive and is helping that are a couple of extra percentage point view gains but 80% of the gains will come from the business cycle you get the business cycle wrong and you cannot make money regardless of where the economic cycle is regardless. The business cycle is very important and again you get it from Con Calls,  annual reports, and the AGM. 


The business cycle used to be a 6-7-year-old cycle you don't know actually the business cycle will last for three years or one years or five years. How do you deal with that predictive model and whether you can actually predict the business cycle anymore? 


So you cannot time the cycles if they are getting shorter and shorter so that's a very valid great point in fact the way the cycles are getting shorter but you still cannot predict it is a good thing in the sense that generation takes a lot of based out of companies start and getting more frugal people are realizing that a lot of the cost can be taken off the P&L because things can be done remotely and so on so the new world will look very different.


The cycles are getting shorter and they are very credible and because they are unpredictable you should try and predict what you can do which is again balance sheet and cash flow and sheet in cash flow but that's ROA, ROC metrics. 


So the business that has the potential to keep the weighted average cost of capital down has the potential to incrementally improve the ROA & ROC through fresh and CAPEX or internal improvements and has the capability to compound the cash flow.


That will create wealth. It will create a lot of wealth if you are prepared to hold such a business for a longer and duration and don't worry about the day to day price generation because in 10-20-30% of all coming understand the business have a conviction to understand the industry structure and follow some sort of framework.


If you are too much obsessed with the numbers and the ratios you will unlikely make a serious success. As Peter Lynch was one of the early guys that Sajal Kapoor started following, read his books and he has got immense respect and credibility.


But Sajal Kapoor has a framework more on the investing side and to build that knowledge you would have to start from somewhere so again he says keep reading,  keep reading, about the business keep reading about other businesses in the same sector, and pick just one sector.


Keep repeating the same thing for every sector you pick and follow the same rigorous process every time.


Thanks to Face2Face hosted by Vivek Bajaj  Co-Founder of stock edge & Elearnmarkets.com.
It was a great and insightful session from Sajal Kapoor, a must-watch session. 
Looking forward to learning from you, sir.

Outlook : Pharma Sector by Aditya Khemka,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/06/outlook-pharma-sector-by-aditya-khemka.html,2020-06-14T06:06:00.005Z,2020-06-14T06:06:00.005Z,Unknown,"Pharma Outlook by the sector veteran Aditya Khemka
Twitter Handle: @shuchi_nahar
Pharma business is divided into two models:

Domestic 

Export 


Domestic Model

This model is typically like an FMCG business. In domestic markets, those pharma companies that have branding power will have a good pricing power among other competitors. 


In pharma, doctors are the main customer of the product and the patient is just a consumer. The patient is going to follow what the doctor suggests and he will prefer only those drugs that will be suggested by a doctor, he won't switch to a generic drug if he is not getting the brand prescribed to him.

Export Model 

This model is basically like a steel business. A demand curve is almost always downward-sloping, reflecting the willingness of consumers to purchase more of the commodity at lower price levels. 
The pharma demand curve is going to be straight, so the question here is what will determine the price?
The answer is simple, supply will determine the demand. The company that can afford the lowest price is going to have the highest market share. 



Pharma Rally in 2015 
This pharma rally was observed in the sector mainly due to export. As earnings growth and valuation were re-rating,  ROE was 20-25% it was attracting new competitors in the market.
As competitors started to step into the industry the price wars among the players started which ultimately separated the wheat from the chaff. 


Current Scenario of the industry 
Currently, the ROE stands at 10-15% which is low in comparison to the past few years. Indian players have the two largest competitors in branded drugs i.e European markets and American markets. 
To revive the sector supply needs to be controlled and that has started happening gradually. 
Many big pharma companies in the USA are filing bankruptcies or getting merged or getting out of the markets. which slowly and gradually is going to control the supply and help the sector revive.


Price to Book value Revival
Price to book value is reviving. A price war is slowly and gradually declining as the best will survive, soon price inflation can be observed.


In recent times it can be seen that pharma stocks have started picking up, it's just a fact that the sector has just corrected itself, from the bottom of P/B value of the 2.5 sectors is trading around 4-5 P/B and has its own peak of 7-8 P/B.


Currently, this hype in prices is observed due to various investors from different sectors like cement, steel, media, etc have started to invest in pharma companies looking at stable growth. 
USFDA will be seen to go lenient on terms of inspection approvals as they will be more focusing on the supply side of the drugs in US markets. 


More consolidation to be seen
There is going to be more handshakes with other companies. As loss-making companies would not be able to survive alone will join their hands with other companies which will be a value addition for the companies and some fixed cost will get clubbed which will remove cost and add the synergies. 
Pharma is a globally competitive industry, those companies having moats will have no fear of facing price wars among competitors.


Pradhanmantri Jan Aushdhi yojana
A campaign launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Government of India, to provide quality medicines at affordable prices to the masses through special kendras known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra. 
Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana Kendra (PMBJPK) has been set up to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs. 
But pharmacies that are set up for this yojna are usually less appreciated, whereas the government also provides subsidies for the initial two years, and after that those pharmacies are usually turned into grocery stores to compensate their fixed cost in the long run. 


Medical technology and medical devices (Blessing in disguise)
This modern artificial intelligence in the pharma sector, effectively is going to be the future for the healthcare sector and will help the patients, doctors in an effective manner but will slowly and gradually disrupt the whole traditional markets going on in India, sooner or later. 
There is a long runway for growth in this domain of the sector. 
In India, there are hardly any players that have diversified themselves in this domain, but there are lots of opportunities to be grabbed in near future in AI for pharma companies.



US Markets 
Drug manufacturing prices are higher by 25-30% in the US in comparison to India. 
Healthcare is closest to the heart of consumers. A trade war between China and the US will gradually give some space to developments of Indian players in US markets as Indian manufacturers hold 47% of the volume share in the US.


CRAMS business
In the export model this type of business won't get affected. The CRAMS model is supported by some tailwinds. CRAMS is a type of business where they have their fixed return as per the contract allocated to those companies. 
Drug selling pressure is going to stay on other players who have their business of selling , packaging of the drugs. 
CRAMS players are just service players and not drug sellers. 
China has a 55bn model when it comes to CRAMS and India has a 5bn market share due to anti china scenario, the demand from Chinese players is going to reduce and India has its foot to capture those markets. Companies with pure-play CRAMS models are expected to grow in near future.


Some Cherry on the top Points:
Healthcare is the consumer-driven market, though your income rises or reduces you are not going to switch from a branded drug to a generic on the cost of your health.
How safe your cash is known from how sustainable that company has cash flows and not from how big that company is.
When per capita GDP increases it will simultaneously increase healthcare expenses.
Developing economies will always focus on branded drugs.
The government banned an irrational combination of drugs.
Pharma is a government-protected industry so competition in the domestic players is bound to be seen.
Most pharma companies do business in spite of having low ROE, having a good risk appetite of suffering loss for 10-15 years, and then earn for 5 years but gradually such companies get merged with sustainable players.
Companies focusing on chronic therapies will have growth opportunities. 
Due to this covid 19 affect healthcare and pharma spending globally will go up.

This summary is totally based on the learning that I gained during the webinar held by ZEN MONEY (DSP Mutual Fund) conducted by Aditya Khemka on 23 May 2020. It was a great learning experience to learn from the sector expert.

So here is the article that will definitely widen the thinking horizon before investing in stocks just by listening to markets. It's a compilation of my understanding from the webinar that I attended.



The start of a new year is always one of the best times to review your investment strategy. We know what happened last year, but 2020 is a chapter waiting to be written. One thing we can count on is that 2020 won’t be exactly like 2019. 

That means no one would have ever thought that 2020 will bring all the unexpected to us. These are the times that were nightmares but anyhow the world is surviving. Staying without work, without income, far from families , pandemic, fire and so on but as its said every coin has two sides lets not forget the good ones.


Unprecedented Times



Never has the world been so connected.


Never has the world come to halt.


Never has there been such levels of debt.


Never have the basic laws of economics/finance been broken.


Never has there been such a response from the government.


Never has there been such disruption for business. 





Source: CBO 

In times of pandemic where the whole world is at a halt, businesses are stopped, people are sitting at home and there is no progress in the economy and debt level are increasing, future growth has gone for a toss.
Rising debt and deficits are driven by the disconnect between spending and revenue. 
CBO projects annual spending will grow by $2.8 trillion from $4.7 trillion (21.3 % of GDP) in 2020 to $7.5 trillion (23.4 % of GDP) by 2030. 


Revenue, meanwhile, will remain between 16.4 % and 17.1 % of GDP through 2025 and then rise to 17.9 % of GDP by 2030 as a result of the expiration of most individual income tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.



What it means for us.


Learning from history is limited.


There is no playbook for this.
Need to revisit everything.
Reactive, not predictive
Just write down what you understand.
Maintain your decision journal.
Understand your basics, and then search sectors accordingly
Sectors, where people gather, are there to go for a toss.                                
Having a habit of the journal will not waste your time but lead you to invest your money efficiently.
Understand your basics, and then search sectors accordingly.
Sectors, where people gather, are there to go for a toss.
Those that will hurt:- Travel, NBFC, Malls, Theaters.
Continue as usual like cement, FMCG, auto, agriculture.
Those will benefit:- Pharma, Chemical,IT.

Start writing things down, don't justify yourself.



Every individual should make their own decision journal , it helps one understand the reason for buying the stock and while selling it. 
Reason for making decision journal is simple when you write things you have clear idea rather than just keeping in mind. 



The broad thought process.


If you are invested already, stay optimistic.


Think of existing positions as cash to be deployed anew.


Don't wait for the right price to come and then you sell it , buying at right price matter most rather than selling.


If you have cash at this point in time, deploy sensibly.


There is no one cash-call-fits-all. Comfort & understanding matters.


Staying on 20% cash, considering the extreme uncertainty is healthy allocation, we don't have to be fully invested when markets are down and have nothing for the time for uncertainty


Don’t deploy everything and keep something for uncertainty.


The market gives you either certainty or valuation, never both!


There can be chances where you don’t find any good investment, but you won’t get both together.


Valuation and numbers are the cornerstones.


Invest carefully.





What should one be doing?


It’s time to focus.


Focus -  Don’t jump all over the place.




Everything is falling. That doesn't mean we have to own everything that has bottom rocked , step when you understand , not when others make you understand.








Don’t jump on things that are new to your understanding 


If you jump to something. That is new to you , you wont understand them though they have fallen you’ll lose time opportunity that you wasted on something new rather than in investing in something that you already had an expertise in. Focus on that industry which you have already have a foot in , jumping to market noises will either make you deaf or a great fall. 


Just because we are analysts doesn’t mean we have to sit and analyze on every other next thing we see, we don't have to be jack of all and master of none. We are good at analyzing companies let's stick to that!


Your portfolio will not consist of the best stock (in hindsight) except that.


Don’t start something new right now, Thinking just for short-term gains.



Avoid Complexities


Complex Companies - like multiple Joint ventures ,Subsidiary, multiple business ,multiple products.


You won’t understand every subsidiary.


Do not get into any flavor of the month: Like Pharma. Chemical




They are trading on high valuation.


Re-evaluate every holding.


If you have researched and Price is falling , it should not really bother you. If its good business - Don't panic (Hold stocks,with deeper conviction.)





They wont help you make money or make you look smarter if you know complex business but it will definitely lose your focus from something you are really good at.

What should one check before Investing?

Few checklist pointers that will help us from not losing money, but surely making one.

No Balance sheet risk (nature, number).


Low complexity business.


A large part of the business is India Centric.


No promoter/management risk.


No history of default. Not interconnected with each other.


When you cannot reach a business completely - avoid that


Business having moat, but not attractive from a valuation.


Good Dividend, Earnings, Cash Flow, Asset value. We should have a good command over these. Look at some valuation parameters. Not overall parameters.


Small/micro caps.



Now they are available at super valuation.


Don’t close eyes to small caps.


If you are uncomfortable in investing in small caps / make a smaller position don’t avoid them completely.


We can never predict the bottom.


Just buying at your level is important, buying at the right price matters



From the fundamental price - we can predict some sense of price, but technical will help decide the selling price more efficiently.


A business that will revive in the short term.


Businesses that are serving the old economy.


Some businesses don't get affected by global economics.


Simpler the business, simpler to understand.



Valuation Driven


Cash - Not finding something according to your understanding, its fine to sit on cash.


When valuation makes sense - That this the time to Invest.


Estimate your fair value of the business. The buying price is the most important factor. If something that doesn’t come on your estimated buying price wait till it comes. 


Volatility in the markets.


Value enough is not okay. he value should be driven with change. Why it would get expensive, should be the first thing to pop up?


Price is reducing - but what is changing. Only if it is getting cheaper is not sufficient


Is Something significant happened and that is giving opportunity for business to grow ?






Is it India Centric business? 


How to decide when to book profit.

Things are very dynamic.


When you purchase something with a targeted price for 9-12 months.


If you get the price 60-70% from your targeted price.


In a bull market, the mind will tell you to wait but in bear market it will help you to decide whether to sell or hold.


The logical extension - decision journal.






Circle of Competence


Knowing what you know is very important.


But knowing what you don’t know is more important.


Defining COC is most important. Do it on paper.


Marrying this concept with a checklist and decision journal helps.


Define a circle of incompetence also.


Look for COC in companies you analyse too.


Always remember, there is no compulsion to invest . MOVE ON!!!


Do not avoid COC because of your laziness.



 Expanding your Circle Of Competence


Pick up an industry you find interesting. Preferably something you can relate to.


Pick up the best performer in the industry and the worst.


Download all material related to both (AR’s, concalls, corporate PPTs,industry reports, broker reports, media etc.)


Pen down value drivers of the business, visit industry people talks!


Revise and Repeat.


This report is wholly based on my understanding and my knowledge gained during the webinar held on 6th June 2020. The notes that will be shared here will be just for knowledge purposes. All the points covered here are the points I fathom during the webinar and have prepared a small note over that.

Why Selling is important and difficult at the same time?,https://myweekendspot.blogspot.com/2020/05/why-selling-is-important-and-difficult.html,2020-05-31T04:05:00.000Z,2020-05-31T04:05:00.000Z,Unknown,"Selling- Art and Science 
Shuchi.P.Nahar


When it comes to selling , everyone of us at some point of time had faced some basic questions, like When to sell? How to decide the right time? What is the right price to exit?
And just to have some sense of confidence we ask in our groups , friends ,peers ; 
kya nikal jaaye ? sahi price aagya kya? uppar jaayega yaha se? Kya lagta hei hold kare ya average out ?
something or the other we must have asked or thought before taking the exit .


So here is the article , that will definitely not tell you the exact price to exit the stock but will surely widen the thinking horizon before selling the stock. Its the compilation of  my understanding from various articles that I read past week . Thanks neeraj sir for sharing such valuables. 


Let me start by saying that selling is the hardest thing to do well as an investor. I don’t think anyone does it well consistently, and that includes the whole slew of investing greats past and present  that I’ve studied. Everyone has sold something only to see it rise higher. And everyone has held onto something only to give back lots of apparent gains.
Second, hold onto stocks blindly. Great investors have always written : Advice to buy right and hold on is intended to counter unproductive activity, not to recommend putting them away and forgetting them.


Sometimes, selling half is costly, as you say. Other times, selling half looks smart. 



Selling your stocks at the right time is arguably the most challenging part of trading and it is fraught with emotions!   There are times when we are wrong and we must exit at a loss – that is hard!  There are times when we buy strong stocks that perform very well, We tend to sell these too early because we doubt that the strength can last.
Then there is the pain of watching a winning trade turn into a loser because we fail to exit at all!









Winner and Wolf sum up:
“These proactive portfolio adjustments do not represent a change in fund management’s fundamental approach to analyzing businesses and the prices of their securities, nor does it mean that we are now engaged in ‘market timing.’ We time our entry and exit from securities positions based upon fundamental valuations, not on expectations of price movements in the market.”
In the end, what you want to do is go in as a buy-and-hold investor. You want the effects of compounding to work for you, as well as the favorable tax treatment that goes along with buy-and-hold. So I think it is important to enter every new investment with a buy-and-hold mentality. Even modest rates of return pile up to extraordinary heights over time. But you also want to be alert to when your thesis is no longer true.

When the main thesis for owning the stock vanishes, it’s often a good time to go. If a great balance sheet is one of the reasons you own something, for example, and it does a deal that makes the balance sheet weak, then it’s time to go. Or if you bought a stock because of a big gap between the stock price and NAV and that gap closes, then it’s time to at least think about selling. This is probably my favorite reason to sell. 


The bottom line: There is no magic way to sell to ensure maximum gains every time out. 


I think anytime you sell, you could cost yourself money if that stock turns out to be a big winner. I understand that risk. On the other hand, as Third Avenue shows, there are also risks in getting too complacent about a holding. When the market gives you a great price to sell, you should be willing to at least think about reducing your position. As long as valuations remain reasonable, though, you may hold a stock indefinitely as the stock and the value of the business grow together over time.



Fundamental Exits: Pros & Cons
Let’s define a fundamental approach to selling as exiting a trade when the stock’s price is greater than its fundamental value. Put that up against the technical approach.   Selling a stock when there is a signal from its trading activity that the stock is more likely to go lower than higher.
While the notion that we should sell a stock if its price is higher than its fundamental value makes a lot of sense, there are major problems in its application.
Should you sell when the stock is overpriced? We are operating in one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies and businesses are nowhere close to saturation. For us, a 5% or 6% growth is a slowdown. We have a lot of growth to see and our businesses have very long runways of future growth ahead. Businesses that can deliver growth without stretching balance sheets and without taking in more capital (through the issuance of new equity shares) and where the quality of growth is excellent in terms of incremental returns on capital—they will increase per share value for stock holders over the long term. 
That potential growth in value is sometimes mispriced by markets even if the stock has appreciated a lot already. Under those circumstances, it would be a mistake to sell. You shouldn’t look at how much money you’ve made, but look at the potential value of the business 10 or 15 years down the road and then take a decision. 
Do not focus on the stock price but on performance of the underlying business. As Warren Buffet says, focus on the playing field, not the scoreboard. Too many investors look at the score board; they tend to focus on the current stock price, the current P/E multiple or the percentage gain in the stock price in relation to the gains in some index or some other stocks.
Sell Signal: P&L Based Exit
Other people sell when a stock drops below their predetermined risk level. Meaning they say I don’t want to lose more than X% on this stock from entry to exit and then raise the stop as the stock rallies.
Trailing stops can be used and adjusted for any of these strategies.
There are many other sell signals but this is just an intro to some of the most common.
This approach is not without its faults. The most common mistake that traders make is taking a too short-term view for the trading style that they are applying. If you are a longer term trader looking for entry signals on a daily chart then you should not be looking for trend line breaks on an intraday chart. It is probably best to look for a longer term entry signal using a weekly chart.
As good traders say, the profit is in the patience.
While remaining disciplined in terms of the process of stock-picking, the seasoned value investor waits patiently for Mr. Market to provide opportunity. Typically, there are just four reasons to sell:


A clear deterioration in either earning power or ‘asset’ value.
Market price exceeds ‘fair’ value by a meaningful margin.
The primary assumptions, or expected catalysts, identified prior to making the investment are unlikely to materialise or are proven to be flawed.
An opportunity likely to yield superior returns (with a high degree of certainty) as compared to the least attractive current holdings is on offer.



Now that the selling compass is pointing in the right direction, perhaps one needs to come to grips with the tribulations of putting these simple ideas into practice. 
The longer I think about why this plagues even expert investors, the more I am struck by the fact that ‘selling smart’ is the dark continent of investing. Just to set the record straight, can you think of more than a couple of books with worthwhile insights on ‘how to sell’ as opposed to the countless investment bestsellers on every other conceivable topic of relevance? 
Should you sell because another stock looks better? If something is working for you, and you don’t have cash and if something else turns up and you like it a lot, then you should sell what’s working for you only when what you want to buy will give you a significantly higher expected return. Otherwise, just hold on to your great businesses and let them compound your capital for you.
So what can we do to avoid costly and annoying errors?


Approach investment decisions from as neutral a position as possible
Ignore all sunk costs by ignoring the cost of the investment when reviewing your portfolio
Accept it as inevitable that you will make mistakes in your buying decisions
You will face tremendous pressure that will tempt you to rationalize your mistakes and not correct them

You will tend to protect the status quo by inventing new reasons to hold on to a bad investment

This will be especially true when your original buying decision is known to many other people who are important to you, as it will hurt you to acknowledge this to them, and to yourself.
It will be difficult for you to correct the mistake because you will attach more importance to saving face by appearing to be consistent with your past commitments.

Don’t overvalue your current positions. Pretend that you don’t own them, and ask, “If I didn’t own this stock today, would I buy it?” If the answer is no, you should think hard about selling.
Don’t compound past mistakes for fear of embarrassment. In the end, the best advice is to learn from mistakes and move on.





Typically, the small profits arising from good luck rather than skill are swiftly pocketed, but whenever a paper loss is sustained the normal investor accounts for it as a ‘long-term investment’ and eventually the lack of skill overwhelms the mis-classification. A third, trickier, phenomenon occurs when a stock rises smartly and then slips into a gradual, but steady decline. In this instance, the issue is a loss of profits! 


This fall causes far less pain, but is just as negative. Two simple rules come to mind. First, what works for me personally, after years of coping with unremitting losses is to sell out completely whenever a new investment shrinks by more than 15 percent. Not only does this deal with my dumber prejudices and blind spots in a ruthlessly efficient manner, more importantly it frees capital. With ‘dead money’ it is probably best to sell one-third, maybe even half the holding rather than the entire position simply because such stocks occasionally experience incredibly short, sharp rebounds. That is probably the moment to get rid of the rest! 


When you are carrying out a portfolio review, resist the temptation to sell the stocks with the best profits. Instead, relentlessly focus on selling the companies which meet the BBBB test — bent, broken or beyond belief!



The decision to sell is complicated. One needs the right dosage of detachment, but then one also needs to be very much attached to the right kinds of businesses and people who run them. The first thing to ask is whether the business is delivering what you envisaged. By and large, is the business is delivering performance in line with your long-term projections? Some slippages must be tolerated. 


Some mis-allocation of capital decisions must be tolerated. It’s important to not measure this performance every quarter. Just because the information is available, you don’t have to use it. Imagine if companies were required to provide monthly performance, not just quarterly. How important would those numbers be? More data does not result in more insights. Often, it results in bad judgments. Equally important is to determine whether or not that performance is coming from variables envisaged and not some other factor. 


If the answer to that is overwhelmingly yes, then you could get pleasantly surprised as great businesses tend to do better than earlier envisaged. So, to help determine if you should hold or sell a business that’s really working for you, use what I call as blue sky scenario. Basically, it means that you should not use the same assumptions you used when you bought the stock. This is especially true when the business you bought into is doing far better than you had anticipated. 


If you bought the right type of business, then there is likely to be tendency for it to deliver better than what you envisaged. If you see that tendency play out after you have invested, don’t ruin it by staying with the original model. Your model has to be adaptive. If the performance is far better (or worse) than you envisaged, you have to change the model unless the improvement (or deterioration is likely to be temporary).



Is investing in equities only about buying good stocks? Let us recall some blockbusters of yesteryears— Jubilant Foods, Just Dial, DLF, Wockhardt, Financial Technologies, BHEL, SAIL, GMR, Kingfisher, Idea, Airtel and Satyam. Not only Indian companies, let us also recall some global bluechips such as Kodak, Blackberry and Nokia. How have these stocks performed in recent years?




Their price performances have not been up to the mark. In fact, most of them have under performed for several years


 Their price performances have not been up to the mark. In fact, most of them have under performed for several years. The lesson is simple: while buying good stocks is certainly a critical part of investing, taking exit calls at the opportune time is also important.




When and how does one take an exit call?


If we look at the above and some other under performing examples, a number of scenarios emerge when one has to take an exit call. The erosion of cash flow visibility is is one of the prime reasons for the under performance of any business. If the business conditions change and the business is not able to generate cash flows in an expected time frame, then it would be very difficult to get returns from such business models. 



In the Indian context, over the past few years, some of the companies that own infrastructure assets have fallen in this category resulting in a sharp under performance.




My Key Takeaways


•The
best sell decision is the one which you have thought at the time of buying that
stock.
•When
your own original hypothesis no longer hold true. The position is breaking your
allocation rules.
•There
is a change in management , and you are not comfortable with.
•Promises
v/s delivery 
•Cash
calls due to market , sell % of all holding
•Business
has undergone a huge change. 
•When
you have something in your portfolio and it doesn’t work as you thought for 1
year then sell.
        Many of you must be thinking that how can selling be Science ? So answer to your doubt is anything that follows a process backed by theory is called as science. We all know the answer for Why selling is an Art but hardly we conclude that Selling is an Art and Science both together. If we understand the depth selling requires a right procedure to be followed every time. Selling requires your thesis and every new experiment brings out the new rule.
